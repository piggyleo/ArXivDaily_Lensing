 - **Abstract**
 Mixing between dark photons and visible photons leads to substantial anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background due to resonant conversions of visible photons into dark photons in baryonic matter found in dark matter halos. In this Letter, we forecast the sensitivity of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) to this signal. We find that SKA could be the first experiment to discover dark photons with a mass between $10^{-13}$ and $5\times 10^{-12}$ eV and kinetic mixing parameter $\epsilon$ as small as $\sim 10^{-8}$ by cross-correlating their data with a low-redshift galaxy survey, potentially improving on the sensitivity from a similar analysis using Planck data by a factor of 4 in $\epsilon$. This improvement is largely due to an enhancement of the signal at low frequencies and the unique experimental advantages of radio telescopes such as small beam sizes.
#### statmorph-lsst: Quantifying and correcting morphological biases in galaxy surveys

 - **Abstract**
 Quantitative morphology provides a key probe of galaxy evolution across cosmic time and environments. However, these metrics can be biased by changes in imaging quality - resolution and depth - either across the survey area or the sample. To prepare for the upcoming Rubin LSST data, we investigate this bias for all metrics measured by statmorph and single-component Sérsic fitting with Galfit. We find that geometrical measurements (ellipticity, axis ratio, Petrosian radius, and effective radius) are fairly robust at most depths and resolutions. Light concentration measurements ($C$, Gini, $M_{20}$) systematically decrease with resolution, leading low-mass or high-redshift bulge-dominated sources to appear indistinguishable from disks. Sérsic index $n$, while unbiased, suffers from a 20-40% uncertainty due to degeneracies in the Sérsic fit. Disturbance measurements ($A$, $A_S$, $D$) depend on signal-to-noise and are thus affected by noise and surface-brightness dimming. We quantify this dependence for each parameter, offer empirical correction functions, and show that the evolution in $C$ observed in JWST galaxies can be explained purely by observational biases. We propose two new measurements - isophotal asymmetry $A_X$ and substructure $St$ - that aim to resolve some of these biases. Finally, we provide a Python package statmorph-lsst implementing these changes and a full dataset that enables tests of custom functions (see text for links).
#### The origin of scatter in the X-ray luminosity - halo mass relation of galaxy clusters

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy groups and clusters are excellent probes of large-scale structure and are shaped by some of the most energetic physical processes in the Universe. They follow a tight scaling relation of X-ray luminosity with halo mass. However, predicting the dependence of the scatter in this relation on mass and redshift is challenging, due to the statistical requirement of large simulation volumes. Using the large volume cosmological hydrodynamical simulations for galaxy cluster physics FLAMINGO and TNG300+TNG-Cluster, we fit this relation and its scatter, focusing on $M_{\rm 500c}>10^{13}~\mathrm{M_\odot}$ and $z \leq 2$. We find qualitatively similar, but quantitatively different results for the two models. For the first time, we study ways to reduce the scatter using properties beyond X-ray luminosity, namely six ICM, six galaxy, and eleven dark matter halo properties. For both FLAMINGO and TNG300+TNG-Cluster, the gas fraction and thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) signal correlate strongest with X-ray scatter, reducing it by over 50% when accounting for their partial correlations. Galaxy and halo properties correlate weakly with X-ray scatter, typically reducing it by 10-20%. Our results are qualitatively robust across different FLAMINGO feedback variations, though the correlations weaken for stronger feedback and with increasing redshift. Differences between FLAMINGO and TNG300+TNG-Cluster are only apparent at the high-mass end - where e.g. the galaxy stellar age correlates strongly for FLAMINGO, but not for TNG300+TNG-Cluster - confirming robustness across physics implementations. We provide fitting formulas for the scatter and its corrections, for direct application to cosmological analyses and observational data.
#### Analysis of the TAIGA-HiSCORE Data Using the Latent Space of Autoencoders

 - **Abstract**
 The aim of extensive air shower (EAS) analysis is to reconstruct the physical parameters of the primary particle that initiated the shower. The TAIGA experiment is a hybrid detector system that combines several imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) and an array of non-imaging Cherenkov detectors (TAIGA-HiSCORE) for EAS detection. Because the signals recorded by different detector types differ in physical nature, the direct merging of data is unfeasible, which complicates multimodal analysis. Currently, to analyze data from the IACTs and TAIGA-HiSCORE, a set of auxiliary parameters specific to each detector type is calculated from the recorded signals. These parameters are chosen empirically, so there is no certainty that they retain all important information and are the best suited for the respective problems. We propose to use autoencoders (AE) for the analysis of TAIGA experimental data and replace the conventionally used auxiliary parameters with the parameters of the AE latent space. The advantage of the AE latent space parameters is that they preserve essential physics from experimental data without prior assumptions. This approach also holds potential for enabling seamless integration of heterogeneous IACT and HiSCORE data through a joint latent space. To reconstruct the parameters of the primary particle of the EAS from the latent space of the AE, a separate artificial neural network is used. In this paper, the proposed approach is used to reconstruct the energy of the EAS primary particles based on Monte Carlo simulation data for TAIGA-HiSCORE. The dependence of the energy determination accuracy on the dimensionality of the latent space is analyzed, and these results are also compared with the results obtained by the conventional technique. It is shown that when using the AE latent space, the energy of the primary particle is reconstructed with satisfactory accuracy.
#### Measuring the Dark Matter Self-Interaction Cross-Section with Deep Compact Clustering for Robust Machine Learning Inference

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09660

 - **Abstract**
 We have developed a machine learning algorithm capable of detecting ``out-of-domain data'' for trustworthy cosmological inference. By using data from two separate suites of cosmological simulations, we show that our algorithm is able to determine whether ``observed'' data is consistent with its training domain, returning confidence estimates as well as accurate parameter estimations. We apply our algorithm to two-dimensional images of galaxy clusters from the BAHAMAS-SIDM and DARKSKIES simulations with the aim to measure the self-interaction cross-section of dark matter. Through deep compact clustering we construct an informative latent space where galaxy clusters are mapped to the latent space forming ``latent-clusters'' for each simulation, with the location of the latent-cluster corresponding to the macroscopic parameters, such as the cross-section, $\sigma_{\rm DM}/m$. We then pass through mock observations, where the location of the observed latent-cluster informs us of which properties are shared with the training data. If the observed latent-cluster shares no similarities with latent-clusters from the known simulations, we can conclude that our simulations do not represent the observations and discard any parameter estimations, thus providing us with a method to measure machine learning confidence. This method serves as a blueprint for transparent and robust inference that is in demand in scientific machine learning.
#### glitterin: Towards Replacing the Role of Lorenz-Mie Theory in Astronomy Using Neural Networks Trained on Light Scattering of Irregularly Shaped Grains

 - **Abstract**
 Light scattering by dust particles is often modeled assuming the dust is spherical for numerical simplicity and speed. However, real dust particles have highly irregular morphologies that significantly affect their scattering properties. We have developed glitterin, a neural network trained to predict light scattering from irregularly shaped dust grains, offering a computationally efficient alternative to Lorenz-Mie theory. We computed scattering properties using the Discrete Dipole Approximation code ADDA for irregularly shaped particles across size parameters x from 0.1 to 65, covering a range in complex refractive index m that includes astrosilicates, pyroxene, enstatite, water-ice, etc. The neural network operates at millisecond timescales while maintaining superior accuracy compared to linear interpolation. Irregular grains exhibit x-dependent deviations from spherical predictions. At small x, cross-sections approach volume-equivalent spheres for low m. At large x, irregular grains show enhanced cross-sections due to greater geometric extension. Increasing m also enhances the absorption cross-section relative to the volume-equivalent spheres. This differential x and m dependence creates mid-IR solid-state features distinct from predictions from spherical grains. Validation against laboratory measurements of forsterite and hematite demonstrates that our neural network captures both qualitative and quantitative behaviors more accurately than spherical models. Millimeter-wavelength applications reveal that spherical grains produce opposite polarization signatures compared to irregular grains, potentially relaxing stringent ~100um grain size constraints in protoplanetary disks. glitterin is publicly available and alleviates the computational barriers to incorporating emission and scattering of realistic grain morphologies.
#### Towards a Machine Learning Solution for Hubble Tension: Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) Analysis of Tsallis Holographic Dark Energy in Presence of Neutrinos

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09706

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09706

 - **Abstract**
 We present a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) framework for reconstructing the redshift-dependent Hubble parameter \(H(z)\) within the Tsallis Holographic Dark Energy (THDE) model extended by massive neutrinos. In this approach, the modified Friedmann equation is incorporated into the neural network loss function, enabling training on Cosmic Chronometers data up to \(z \leq 2\). The framework allows for the simultaneous estimation of the Hubble constant \(H_0\), the neutrino density parameter \(\Omega_\nu\), and the Tsallis non-extensivity index \(\delta\). Uncertainty quantification is performed through dropout simulations, resulting in statistically consistent \(1\sigma\) confidence bands. Our results show that the THDE+$\nu$ model, reconstructed via PINN, alleviates the statistical Hubble tension from the canonical \(\sim 5\sigma\) level down to a range of \(0.5\sigma \leq T \leq 2.2\sigma\), depending on the redshift sampling. Additionally, we constrain the total neutrino mass to \(\Sigma m_\nu < 0.11\,\text{eV}\). A detailed comparison with the traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis demonstrates the consistency of both methods, while highlighting the competitiveness of the PINN-based THDE framework as a robust, data-driven approach for non-parametric cosmological inference within generalized thermodynamics.
#### Towards model-free stellar chemical abundances. Potential applications in the search for chemically peculiar stars in large spectroscopic surveys

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09733

 - **Abstract**
 Chemical abundance determinations from stellar spectra are challenged by observational noise, limitations in stellar models, and departures from simplifying assumptions. While traditional and supervised machine learning methods have made remarkable progress in estimating atmospheric parameters and chemical compositions within existing physical models, these factors still constrain our ability to fully exploit the vast data sets provided by modern spectroscopic surveys. We aim to develop a self-supervised, disentangled representation learning framework that extracts chemically meaningful features directly from spectra, without relying on externally imposed label catalogs. We build a variational autoencoder-based representation learning model with physics-inspired structure: multiple decoders each focus on spectral regions dominated by a particular element, enforcing that each latent dimension maps to a single abundance. To evaluate the potential application of our framework, we trained and validated the model on low-resolution, low signal-to-noise synthetic spectra focusing on $\rm [Fe/H]$, $\rm [C/Fe]$, and $\rm [\alpha/Fe]$. We then demonstrate how the trained model can be used to flag stars as chemically enhanced or depleted in these abundances based on their position within the latent distribution. Our model successfully learns a representation of spectra whose axes correlate tightly with the target abundances ($r=0.92\pm0.01$ for $\rm [Fe/H]$, $r=0.92\pm0.01$ for $\rm [C/Fe]$, $r=0.82\pm0.02$ for $\rm [\alpha/Fe]$). The disentangled representations provide a robust means to distinguish stars based on their chemical properties, offering an efficient and scalable solution for large spectroscopic surveys.
#### fiDrizzle-MU: A Fast Iterative Drizzle with Multiplicative Updates

Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09881

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09881

 - **Abstract**
 We propose fiDrizzleMU, an algorithm for co-adding exposures via iterative multiplicative updates, replacing the additive correction framework. This method achieves superior anti-aliasing and noise reduction in stacked images. When applied to James Webb Space Telescope data, the fiDrizzleMU algorithm reconstructs a gravitational lensing candidate that was significantly blurred by the pipeline's resampling process. This enables the accurate recovery of faint and extended structures in high-resolution astronomical imaging.
#### findAbar: how astronomers may perceive the bar in galaxies differently

 - **Abstract**
 Bars are ubiquitous morphological features in the observed distribution of galaxies. There are similarly many methods for classifying these features and, without a strict theoretical definition or common standard practice, this is often left to circumstance. So, we were concerned whether astronomers even agree on the bar which they perceive in a given galaxy and whether this could impact perceived scientific results. As an elementary test, we twenty-one astronomers with varied experience in studying resolved galaxies and circumstances, have each assessed 200 galaxy images, spanning the early phase of bar evolution in two different barred galaxy simulations. We find variations exist within the classification of all the standard bar parameters assessed: bar length, axis-ratio, pitch-angle and even whether a bar is present at all. If this is indicative of the wider community, it has implications for interpreting morphological trends, such as bar-end effects. Furthermore, we find that it is surprisingly not expertise but gender, followed by career stage, which gives rise to the largest discrepancies in the reported bar parameters. Currently, automation does not seem to be a viable solution, with bar classifications from two automated bar-finding algorithms tested and failing to find bars in snapshots where most astronomers agree a bar must exist. Increasing dependence on machine learning or crowdsourcing with a training dataset can only serve to obfuscate any existing biases if these originate from the specific astronomer producing the training material. On the strength of this small sample, we encourage an interim best practice to reduce the impact of any possible classification bias and set goals for the community to resolve the issue in the future.
#### Slow neutrinos: non-linearity and momentum-space emulation

 - **Abstract**
 Recent cosmological bounds on the sum of neutrino masses, M_nu = sum m_nu, are in tension with laboratory oscillation experiments, making cosmological tests of neutrino free-streaming imperative. In order to study the scale-dependent clustering of massive neutrinos, we develop a fast linear response method, FAST-nu f, applicable to neutrinos and other non-relativistic hot dark matter. Using it as an accurate linear approximation to help us reduce the dynamic range of emulator training data, based upon a non-linear perturbation theory for massive neutrinos, we improve the emulator's accuracy at small M_nu and length scales by a factor of two. We significantly sharpen its momentum resolution for the slowest neutrinos, which, despite their small mass fraction, dominate small-scale clustering. Furthermore, we extend the emulator from the degenerate to the normal and inverted mass orderings. Applying this new emulator, Cosmic-Enu-II, to large halos in N-body simulations, we show that non-linear perturbation theory can reproduce the neutrino density profile in the halo outskirts, 2R_vir < r < 10R_vir , to better than 10%.
#### Where Galaxies Point: First Measurement of the Large-Scale Axial Intrinsic Alignment

 - **Abstract**
 Applying a new estimator to the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Y3 weak lensing shape catalog, we map the galaxies' orientation field and report the first detection of a large-scale axial intrinsic alignment (LAIA) on dipolar angular scales. Ellipticals' semi-major axes and spirals' semi-minor axes coherently point toward a common direction, (RA,Dec)=$(306^{+6}_{-4},52^{+3}_{-3})^\circ$ and $(296^{+10}_{-18},50^{+6}_{-2})^\circ$, respectively, with amplitudes in the expected tidal-torquing hierarchy. This pattern could be produced by a horizon-scale tidal field imprinted by primordial inhomogeneities during galaxy assembly and can probe deviations from statistical isotropy. The signal persists across spatial and redshift splits and is difficult to attribute to survey systematics. LAIA offers a new sky-wide compass linking galaxy evolution and cosmology.
#### How much can we learn from resolved stellar kinematics of galactic haloes using action-based dynamical models?

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10445

 - **Abstract**
 Dynamical models are used to study dark matter (DM) in galaxies, how galaxies assemble through mergers, and to test galaxy formation models. Despite its widespread use, there has been no systematic study quantifying how much information can be obtained from just two on-sky positions and line-of-sight velocities, which are typically available for nearby external galaxies. In this work, we introduce axisymmetric, action-based dynamical models that use the positions and velocities of stellar halo stars to jointly constrain the total mass distribution of galaxies and the underlying DM component, as well as the stellar halo phase-space distribution. We rigorously test the method using both idealised equilibrium galaxy mocks and cosmological hydrodynamical simulations from the Auriga suite, systematically assessing how its performance degrades as the available phase-space information is progressively reduced. We further examine the impact of galaxy inclination, modelling assumptions, and methodological systematics on the recovered mass profiles. A crucial development in this work is the improved marginalisation of the model likelihood over missing phase-space dimensions. Our models successfully recover the total and DM mass distributions, as well as the kinematic properties of the stellar tracers, within the derived confidence intervals. However, we find that with limited (3D or 4D) phase-space information, the flattening of the DM halo cannot be constrained with any degree of certainty. Nevertheless, the recovered mass profile is insensitive to the flattening. This finding is independently validated by Schwarzschild modelling tests.
#### Bayesian model comparison and validation with Gaussian Process Regression for interferometric 21-cm signal recovery

 - **Abstract**
 The 21-cm signal from neutral hydrogen is anticipated to reveal critical insights into the formation of early cosmic structures during the Cosmic Dawn and the subsequent Epoch of Reionization. However, the intrinsic faintness of the signal, as opposed to astrophysical foregrounds, poses a formidable challenge for its detection. Motivated by the recent success of machine learning based Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) methods in LOFAR and NenuFAR observations, we perform a Bayesian comparison among five GPR models to account for the simulated 4-hour tracking observations with the SKA-Low telescope. The simulated sky is convolved with the instrumental beam response and includes realistic radio sources and thermal noise from 122 to 134 MHz. A Bayesian model evaluation framework is applied to five GPR models to discern the most effective modelling strategy and determine the optimal model parameters. The GPR model with wedge parametrization ($\textit{Wedge}$) and its extension ($\alpha\textit{Noise}$) with noise scaling achieve the highest Bayesian evidence of the observed data and the least biased 21-cm power spectrum recovery. The $\alpha\textit{Noise}$ and $\textit{Wedge}$ models also forecast the best local power-spectrum recovery, demonstrating fractional differences of $-0.14\%$ and $0.47\%$ respectively, compared to the injected 21-cm power at $k = 0.32\ \mathrm{h\ cMpc}^{-1}$. We additionally perform Bayesian null tests to validate the five models, finding that the two optimal models also pass with the remaining three models yielding spurious detections in data containing no 21-cm signal.

 - **Abstract**
 Since the first observations of interstellar molecules, astrochemical simulations have been employed to model and understand its formation and destruction path- ways. With the advent of high-resolution telescopes such as JWST and ALMA, the number of detected molecules has increased significantly, thereby creating a need for increasingly complex chemical reaction networks. To model such complex systems, we have developed Carbox, a new astrochemical simulation code that leverages the modern high-performance transformation framework Jax. With Jax enabling computational efficiency and differentiability, Carbox can easily utilize GPU acceleration, be used to study sensitivity and uncertainty, and interface with advances in Scientific Machine Learning. All of these features are crucial for modeling the molecules observed by current and next-generation telescopes.
#### Co-evolution of baryons and dark matter halos of LYRA dwarf galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 We use the extremely high-resolution ($m_{\rm bary}=4\rm{M}_\odot$) LYRA cosmological galaxy formation simulations of six dwarf galaxies with $M_{\rm 200c}\sim10^9\rm{M}_\odot$ at $z=0$ to investigate their stellar assembly histories. Based on the age of stars in these galaxies at $z=0$, $40-100\%$ of their stellar mass was formed by the time of reionization, when star formation (SF) abruptly shuts down. Depending on their halo mass evolution, some of the dwarfs reignite SF post-reionization (rejuvenators), while others remain quenched for the rest of cosmic time (reionization relics). However, the stellar mass of relics can still grow by more than $50\%$ through mergers post-reionisation. We find clear correlations between metallicity distributions of the galaxies and the fraction of stars formed post-reionization ($f_{\rm post-reio}^\star$) such that relics have lower median $\rm [Fe/H]$ with a more prominent low metallicity tail. Moreover, the shape of the galaxies at $z=0$ correlates with their $f_{\rm post-reio}^\star$, with rejuvenators showing more spherical stellar distribution than relics. This difference arises only post-reionization when rejuvenators become rounder with more SF activity. Similarly, the shape of dark matter (DM) halos in the inner regions display more spherical distributions in rejuvenators than in relics. The shape evolution shows that DM haloes in all galaxy formation simulations become rounder in comparison to their collision-less, DM-only counterparts. However, DM haloes of rejuvenators evolve more significantly. We do not find any correlation between SF activity and formation of shallow DM density cores in these galaxies. These predictions can be tested using upcoming observational data. In particular, our results indicate that the scatter in the mass-metallicity relation in the low mass regime is correlated with SF histories and the shape of galaxies.
#### Dark Matter from Holography

 - **Abstract**
 Previous studies have examined the holographic principle as a means of producing dark energy. Here we propose instead the possibility of holographic dark matter. In this case, dark matter does not arise in the framework of particle physics but is derived from the infrared cutoff set by the horizon scale. Using the Ricci cutoff, and a universe containing only baryons and radiation, we can account for the dark matter and naturally explain the coincidence between baryonic and nonbaryonic contributions to the density. In the presence of a pre-existing vacuum energy density our model reverses the sign of this density, thus accounting for the fact that certain string theories generically predict a negative vacuum energy, but observations require a positive value.
