#### Constraints on the Hot Circumgalactic Medium around Nearby L* Galaxies from SRG/eROSITA All Sky Survey

 - **Abstract**
 The circumgalactic medium (CGM) is a multi-phase, dynamic interface between galaxy and the intergalactic medium, providing crucial diagnostics of galaxy evolution. However, direct evidence for a hot (million-Kelvin) CGM around present-day L* galaxies remains elusive. Here, we present the first systematic search of the hot CGM around nearby (< 50 Mpc) L* galaxies, by stacking their X-ray images and spectra from the SRG/eROSITA all-sky survey. Significant diffuse X-ray emission is detected out to ~ 50 kpc, with spectral signatures consistent with a hot gas but arguing against a predominantly non-thermal origin. The radial distribution and total amount of the hot gas are in agreement with prediction by IllustrisTNG simulations. The constraints on the hot CGM derived in this study hold promise for calibrating key physical processes in next-generation cosmological simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 Strongly lensed quasars in cusp configurations provide a uniquely sensitive probe of small-scale dark matter structure. Using the largest microlensing-free flux ratios for 17 quadruply imaged cusps, we combine these with extensive Monte Carlo simulations of mock lens realizations under cold dark matter (CDM), self-interacting dark matter (SIDM), and fuzzy dark matter (FDM) scenarios. Building on this, we propose a region (minor-axis and narrow major-axis cusp lenses) where flux-ratio anomalies persist even under globally parameterized models ("macromodels") with multipole freedom (capturing disk, asymmetric, or merger-driven structures). Within this region, J1042+1641 is $>3\sigma$ incompatible with both CDM and SIDM. Our results yield a Bayes factor exceeding $100$, providing very strong evidence for FDM over even the most optimistic CDM and SIDM scenarios. As only 11 cusp lenses lie within this region, extending to larger samples will be essential for assessing its statistical generality and for decisively confirming these findings with future microlensing-free flux ratio data.

 - **Abstract**
 The cosmological tensions present in the $\Lambda$ cold dark matter model that have emerged and strengthened over recent years motivate model independent approaches to analysing data. Cosmography is useful for interpreting data in cosmology without imposing assumptions about the field equations of gravity or the matter content in the Universe. Some cosmography methods, denoted covariant cosmography, go even further and stay agnostic to the underlying space-time metric. Due to their high level of generality, covariant cosmography methods can incorporate the anisotropies and inhomogeneities in the observer's vicinity, and may in turn inform about the associated curvature of the relevant structures in our cosmic neighbourhood. Thus, covariant cosmography is a powerful model-independent tool for analysing cosmological data while also enabling the mapping of our local cosmic neighbourhood. In order to be able to explore the covariant cosmography framework to its fullest, it must be tested in tractable models and simulations. In this paper we derive the cosmography of luminosity distance to fourth order in redshift and investigate it in the special case of axially symmetric Szekeres models. We compare the numerical results for the distance-redshift relations of synthetic observers placed within the Szekeres structures with the predictions from the cosmography, and comment on the found level of approximation of the cosmography in relation to other results in the litterature.
#### Forecast on the generalised dark matter properties from a Euclid-like survey

Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO)

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.16943

 - **Abstract**
 The Stage~IV \textit{Euclid} mission will deliver spectroscopic galaxy redshifts together with photometric positions and shapes, enabling cosmological analyses through spectroscopic galaxy clustering (GCsp), photometric galaxy clustering (GCph), weak-lensing cosmic shear (WL), and their cross-correlation (XC). In this work we forecast the constraining power of a Euclid-like survey on the Generalised Dark Matter (GDM) parameters \(w_{\rm gdm}\) and \(c^{2}_{s,{\rm gdm}}\). Our analysis extends previous forecasting pipeline used for standard cold dark matter. For GCsp, we adopt a semi-analytic nonlinear RSD model, with free terms for each bin. For the photometric probes, we compute the nonlinear GDM matter power spectrum using dedicated simulations, and we modify the lensing and clustering window and the intrinsic-alignment prescription. We consider several survey configurations and explore three fiducial values of \(\sigma_8\) motivated by current CMB and low-redshift measurements. In an optimistic setting, for fiducial values \(\sigma_8 \simeq 0.81\) and \(\sigma_8 \simeq 0.77\), we find relative errors of \(4.01\%\) (GCsp), \(5.01\%\) (GCph+WL+XC), and \(1.96\%\) (all probes) on \(c^{2}_{s,{\rm gdm}}\), and \(3.26\%\) (GCph+WL+XC) and \(1.85\%\) (all probes) on \(w_{\rm gdm}\). For a lower fiducial value \(\sigma_8 \simeq 0.67\), that could strongly disfavor $\Lambda$GDM, we find constraints of \(5\%\) (GCsp), \(5\%\) (GCph+WL+XC), and \(2.45\%\) (all probes) on \(c^{2}_{s,{\rm gdm}}\), and \(3.43\%\) (GCph+WL+XC) and \(2.04\%\) (all probes) on \(w_{\rm gdm}\). We also found that, combining all probes, whether in the pessimistic or optimistic settings, a Euclid-like survey will be able to disentangle between the three scenarios. These results show that the survey will be able to constrain the GDM parameters and distinguish between normalisations of the matter fluctuations.(Abridged)
