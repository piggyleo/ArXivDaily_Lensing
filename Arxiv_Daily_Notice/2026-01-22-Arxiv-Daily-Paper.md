 - **Abstract**
 We demonstrate the capabilities of probabilistic diffusion models to reduce dramatically the computational cost of expensive hydrodynamical simulations to study the relationship between observable baryonic cosmological probes and dark matter at field level and well into the non-linear regime. We introduce a novel technique, Cosmo-FOLD (Cosmological Fields via Overlap Latent Diffusion) to rapidly generate accurate and arbitrarily large cosmological and astrophysical 3-dimensional fields, conditioned on a given input field. We are able to generate TNG300-2 dark matter density and gas temperature fields from a model trained only on ~1% of the volume (a process we refer to as `upscaling'), reproducing both large scale coherent dark matter filaments and power spectra to within 10% for wavenumbers k <= 5 h Mpc^-1. These results are obtained within a small fraction of the original simulation cost and produced on a single GPU. Beyond one and two points statistics, the bispectrum is also faithfully reproduced through the inclusion of positional encodings. Finally, we demonstrate Cosmo-FOLD's generalisation capabilities by upscaling a CAMELS volume of 25 (Mpc h^-1)^3 to a full TNG300-2 volume of 205 (Mpc h^-1)^3$ with no fine-tuning. Cosmo-FOLD opens the door to full field-level simulation-based inference on cosmological scale.

 - **Abstract**
 Studies of galactic bars have primarily focused on stellar bars, since they can be directly observed through ultraviolet to infrared wavebands. Cosmological as well as idealised simulations reveal that the dark matter (DM) haloes interact with baryonic matter, primarily the stellar bars, dynamically by means of the exchange of angular momentum. In these simulations, the spherical DM halo dynamically responds to interaction with the stellar bar by reshaping its orbital structure in the proximity of the stellar bar, forming a bar-like configuration, called as the Dark Matter (DM) bar. Using N-body simulations of Milky Way analogs we discuss the role of inner halo angular momentum, measured as halo spin parameter {\lambda} of the dark matter halo, on formation and evolutionary characteristics of the DM bars. Our systematic study involves haloes with initial spin configurations ranging from {\lambda} = 0 to 0.1. The result conveys that DM bar formation and its characteristics are extensively dependent on the initial spin parameter {\lambda} of the DM halo. We demonstrate that the strength of the dark matter bar gradually increases with an increase in halo spin in long-term evolution, with a significant impact of stellar bar buckling on dark matter bar strength. The evolutionary characteristics of the DM bar are strongly influenced by the initial spin of the host halo.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a spectroscopic survey of field galaxies and lensed sources in the vicinity of the strong lensing galaxy cluster known as the Carousel lens at z=0.49. Using both Gemini/GMOS slitmask spectra and deep VLT/MUSE observations, we bring the total number of lensed sources up to 13, including three which were not previously known from imaging observations but are apparent in the MUSE data as emission-line sources. Of these sources, 10 have confident redshifts, and an additional 2 have tentative redshifts from likely Ly$\alpha$ emission (including seven new redshifts determined here adding to those presented previously in Sheu et al. (2024)). The lensed sources span a redshift range from z=0.96 to 4.09 with most of them showing 3-5 images, including four sources displaying central or radial images. In total, we identify 43 images of these 13 sources. This lens system is remarkably symmetric and well-modeled by a simpler lens model than typical cluster lenses, and the large number of sources and their large range of redshifts make this cluster ideal for constraining cosmological parameters such as $w$ and $\Omega_m$ as well as the cluster density profile. Additionally, we present a catalog of 57 unlensed field galaxies with confident redshifts, of which 49 are associated with the cluster. We measure a cluster velocity dispersion of about 1100 km s$^{-1}$ from which we estimate a halo mass $M_{200c} \approx 1.2 \times 10^{15} M_\odot$.

 - **Abstract**
 The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) will be a large ultraviolet/optical/near-infrared space telescope operating at the Sun-Earth Lagrange point L2. HWO was highly recommended by the National Academies` 2020 decadal survey and will be the first telescope designed specifically to search for life on planets orbiting other stars. HWO will also be able to perform a host of other transformational astrophysics, including cosmology, galaxy evolution, solar system science, and beyond. The development of the telescope and instrument suite is an iterative process. Example observatory architectures, called exploratory analytic cases (EACs) by the HWO Technology Maturation Project Office (TMPO), are modeled end-to-end to explore the engineering and science trade space. Recently, an ultraviolet Integral Field Spectrograph (UV IFS) was added to HWO's instrument suite for the EACs 4 and 5. To explore the science and engineering trade space for this specific instrument, we developed a high-fidelity UV IFS simulation tool, PyISH. The UV IFS simulation tool is designed to be used by scientists to model specific science cases as seen by a UV IFS on HWO, as well as engineers to explore the trade space when developing potential instrument architectures. The modular components, deliverables, and an example of the tool simulating a specific science case proposed for HWO are described in this paper.

 - **Abstract**
 We present cosmology results combining galaxy clustering and weak gravitational lensing measured in the full six years (Y6) of observations by the Dark Energy Survey (DES) covering $\sim$5000 deg$^2$. We perform a large-scale structure analysis using three two-point correlation functions (3$\times$2pt): (i) cosmic shear from 140 million source galaxy shapes, (ii) galaxy clustering of 9 million lens galaxy positions, and (iii) galaxy-galaxy lensing from their cross-correlation. We model the data in flat $\Lambda$CDM and $w$CDM cosmologies. The combined analysis yields $S_8\equiv \sigma_8 (\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3)^{0.5} = 0.789^{+0.012}_{-0.012}$ and matter density $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.333^{+0.023}_{-0.028}$ in $\Lambda$CDM (68\% CL), where $\sigma_8$ is the clustering amplitude. These constraints show a (full-space) parameter difference of 1.8$\sigma$ from a combination of cosmic microwave background (CMB) primary anisotropy datasets from Planck 2018, ACT-DR6, and SPT-3G DR1. Projected only into $S_8$ the difference is $2.6\sigma$. In $w$CDM the Y6 3$\times$2pt results yield $S_8 = 0.782^{+0.021}_{-0.020}$, $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.325^{+0.032}_{-0.035}$, and dark energy equation-of-state parameter $w = -1.12^{+0.26}_{-0.20}$. For the first time, we combine all DES dark-energy probes: 3$\times$2pt, SNe Ia, BAO and Clusters. In $\Lambda$CDM this combination yields a $2.8\sigma$ parameter difference from the CMB. When combining DES 3$\times$2pt with other low-redshift datasets (DESI DR2 BAO, DES SNe Ia, SPT clusters), we find a 2.3$\sigma$ parameter difference with CMB. A joint fit of Y6 3$\times$2pt, CMB, and those low-redshift datasets produces the tightest $\Lambda$CDM constraints to date: $S_8 = 0.806^{+0.006}_{-0.007}$, $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.302^{+0.003}_{-0.003}$, $h = 0.683^{+0.003}_{-0.002}$, and $\sum m_\nu < 0.14$ eV (95\% CL). In $w$CDM, this combination yields $w = -0.981^{+0.021}_{-0.022}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Axion-like particles (ALPs) are hypothetical particles and compelling candidates for cold dark matter. Their existence could be probed through their conversions into photons in the presence of magnetic fields. In this work, we explore the effect of these photon-ALP conversions by searching for an attenuation in the observed gamma ray spectra of galactic sources that emit at energies of hundreds of TeV. We analyze data from the High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Observatory for the source 3HWC J1908+063. No evidence of photon-ALP conversions was found, and we set constraints on the ALP parameter space. Specifically, we derive exclusion limits for ALPs with masses in the range $10^{-8}~\mathrm{eV} \leq m_a \leq 10^{-6}~\mathrm{eV}$ and photon-ALP couplings in the range $10^{-12}~\mathrm{GeV}^{-1} \leq g_{a\gamma} \leq 10^{-10}~\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$, based on HAWC observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Double source plane strong lensing (DSPL) systems offer a robust, independent probe of cosmological parameters. The Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST) is expected to discover hundreds of DSPLs, yet the survey modes and system configurations that best enable cosmological inference remain uncertain. To investigate the impact of varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and Einstein radius ratios of DSPLs (denoted as $\beta^{-1}$ parameters) on cosmographic inference under different CSST survey modes (Wide Field (WF), Deep Field (DF), and Ultra-Deep Field (UDF)), we simulate and model mock lenses with Singular Isothermal Ellipsoid (SIE) mass profiles and Sérsic sources whose image properties are tailored to CSST specifications. Assuming a flat $w$CDM universe with fiducial values $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.30966$ and $w = -1$, and uniform priors of $\Omega_{\rm m} \in [0, 1]$ and $w \in [-2, -1/3$), we find that the constraining power on cosmological parameters for a given DSPL system increases significantly with survey depth. For a representative DSPL system with two prominent arcs and a moderate $\beta^{-1}=1.17$, the constraints on ($w, \Omega_{\rm m}$) improve from ($-1.28_{-1.00}^{+0.64}, 0.50_{-0.32}^{+0.28}$) in the WF to ($-1.59_{-0.32}^{+0.63}, 0.42_{-0.06}^{+0.15}$) in the UDF. Furthermore, we find that systems with smaller $\beta$ values yield tighter cosmographic constraints. We conclude that DSPL systems identified in UDF observations, particularly those with small $\beta$, are the most promising candidates for early-stage cosmological studies with CSST.
#### Dark Energy Survey Year 6 Results: Magnification modeling and its impact on galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing cosmology

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational lensing magnification alters the observed spatial distribution of galaxies and must be accounted for to prevent biases in cosmological probes of the large-scale structure. We investigate its effects on the Dark Energy Survey Year 6 galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing analyses using the fiducial lens (position tracer) sample MagLim++. Magnification bias is parameterized by a coefficient that describes the response of the number of selected objects per unlensed area element to a change in the lensing convergence. We quantify this coefficient using the Balrog synthetic source injection catalog to account for the complexity of the selection function, and compare these results with simplified estimates. The resulting values of the magnification coefficients for each redshift bin are [3.16 $\pm$ 0.08, 2.76 $\pm$ 0.21, 4.09 $\pm$ 0.15, 4.42 $\pm$ 0.16, 4.90 $\pm$ 0.29, 4.83 $\pm$ 0.25]. Relative to Year 3, this analysis provides more precise and accurate magnification bias estimates through a larger Balrog area and reweighting to better match the data properties. The cosmological results are robust when tested against various magnification parameter prior choices and also when adding cross-clustering between lens redshift bins. Neglecting magnification, however, introduces significant systematic shifts: relative to the fiducial analysis with Gaussian priors centered on the Balrog-derived estimates, we observe shifts of 1.37$\sigma$ in $S_8$ and -0.84$\sigma$ in $\Omega_m$ (with cosmic shear included: -0.61$\sigma$ in $S_8$ and -0.71$\sigma$ in $\Omega_m$), in agreement with findings from simulated data, demonstrating that magnification must be modeled to avoid biases. Freeing the magnification bias in lens bin 2 leads to unphysical negative values, further justifying its exclusion from the fiducial Year 6 analysis.
