 - **Abstract**
 Hierarchical mergers of galaxy clusters play a key role in converting gravitational energy into thermal and kinetic energy in the local universe. Understanding this process requires the reconstruction of cluster merger geometry, with careful consideration of projection effects. With its unprecedented spectral resolution, XRISM enables the disentanglement of merging cluster components along the line-of-sight via X-rays for the first time. In this letter, we focus on the massive cluster A1914, a puzzling case wherein the galaxy and dark matter distribution appear to be in tension with the X-ray morphology. We present XRISM observations of A1914 focusing on the velocity structure of the intracluster medium (ICM). The Resolve full-array spectrum requires two merging components along the line-of-sight, with bulk velocities offset by $\sim$1000 km/s and velocity dispersions of $\sim$200 km/s. The sub-array maps of flux ratios, bulk velocity, and velocity dispersion show the two components are offset and overlapping in the plane of the sky, consistent with a major (mass ratio $\sim$3), near line-of-sight merger with a pericenter distance of $\sim$200 kpc. We conclude that the two subclusters create an overlapping spiral pattern, referred to as a ''yin-yang'' merger. This scenario is further supported by tailored hydrodynamical simulations of the A1914 merger, demonstrating that this type of merger can broadly reproduce the observed X-ray morphology, gas temperature map, gas velocity maps, dark matter distribution, and galaxy velocities. This work demonstrates the power of high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy, provided by XRISM, to resolve complex cluster merger geometries.

 - **Abstract**
 We test the Platonic Representation Hypothesis (PRH) in astronomy by measuring representational convergence across a range of foundation models trained on different data types. Using spectroscopic and imaging observations from JWST, HSC, Legacy Survey, and DESI, we compare representations from vision transformers, self-supervised models, and astronomy-specific architectures via mutual $k$-nearest neighbour analysis. We observe consistent scaling: representational alignment generally increases with model capacity across our tested architectures, supporting convergence toward a shared representation of galaxy astrophysics. Our results suggest that astronomical foundation models can use pre-trained general-purpose architectures, allowing us to capitalise on the broader machine learning community's already-spent computational investment.

 - **Abstract**
 Dwarf Spheroidal (dSph) galaxies are very promising laboratories for the indirect search for dark matter (DM), due to their low astrophysical background in radio and gamma-ray frequencies. This is convenient when considering Weakly Interacting Dark Matter (WIMP) that can annihilate and produce radio continuum emission. Radio detections of dSph galaxies, however, prove to be difficult and motivate the consideration of transient galaxies that have just recently become quiescent. For the past several decades, the prompt emission from DM annihilation signatures has been explored through modeling and the setting of limits. In addition to the prompt annihilation signatures from neutrinos, gamma-rays, electrons, positrons, and antimatter, the secondary emission from charged annihilation products undergoing radiative loss processes also contributes to the picture. For instance, synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton scattering of charged products such as electrons and positrons can provide a significant signal. The quantitative modeling of this secondary emission with the astrophysical background is necessary to place stringent constraints on the nature of DM. In this work, the multi-wavelength secondary spectrum of DM annihilation for a dwarf galaxy is calculated using the open-source code CRPropa 3.2, which enables the self-consistent treatment of the astrophysical background and secondary emissions. We present a systematic comparison of signatures from conventional astrophysical processes to those expected from DM annihilation. The morphological differences between the two scenarios are investigated. Tests of the impact of different magnetic fields, DM masses, and DM profiles will be performed in the next steps.
#### Early galaxy evolution: The complex interstellar medium distribution of the z~7 galaxy A1689-zD1

 - **Abstract**
 We observed the gravitationally lensed ($\mu = 9.6\pm0.19$) galaxy A1689-zD1 at $z = 7.1$ in bands 3, 6, and 8 of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. These high-resolution observations ($\approx 200$ pc) enabled us to separate the source into five components in the [CII] 158$\mu$m and [OIII] 88$mu$m emission lines within a projected distance of 2 kpc. Even though these components appear to vary strongly from one another in both their line, continuum, and optical characteristics, the assembly of components do not show ordered rotation and appear consistent with simulations of a galaxy system undergoing the process of assembly. The total dynamical mass of the galaxy ($2\times10^{10}$ M$_\odot$) is an order of magnitude larger than the spectrally estimated stellar mass, suggesting a near-complete optical obscuration of the bulk of the stellar component. Comparing the line ratios as well as the line properties to other properties such as the star formation rate, we find that A1689-zD1 is consistent with the relations derived from local star-forming galaxies. Even though A1689-zD1 lies on local star formation scaling relations and has a high dust and stellar mass estimate, the kinematics suggest it is in an early assembly stage, which could lead to it becoming a disk galaxy at a later stage.

 - **Abstract**
 Baryonic feedback is a leading contaminant in studying dark matter and cosmology using cosmic shear. This has meant omitting much of the data during cosmological inference, or forward-modeling the spatial distribution of gas around dark matter halos using analytical or hydrodynamical models for baryonic feedback, which introduces nuisance parameters and model dependence. We propose a novel method of ``baryon nulling'' using cross-correlations between shear maps and fast radio burst (FRB) dispersion measures. By directly subtracting the dark matter--dispersion measure cross-correlation, the sensitivity of our nulled power spectra to feedback effects can be significantly reduced without any explicit feedback modeling. Using the FLAMINGO suite of hydrodynamic simulations, whose power spectra span a wide yet realistic range of feedback variations, we demonstrate that our method reduces sensitivity to feedback modeling at $k \approx 1$ Mpc$^{-1}$ by about an order of magnitude. This points toward a strong synergy between the next generation of sensitive FRB surveys such as CHORD and the DSA-2000, and cosmic shear surveys such as Rubin, Euclid, and Roman.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a structural analysis of bulges in dual active galactic nuclei (AGN) host galaxies. Dual AGN arise in galaxy mergers where both supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are actively accreting. The AGN are typically embedded in compact bulges, which appear as luminous nuclei in optical images. Galaxy mergers can result in bulge growth, often via star formation. The bulges can be disky (pseudobulges), classical bulges, or belong to elliptical galaxies. Using SDSS DR18 gri images and GALFIT modelling, we performed 2D decomposition for 131 dual AGN bulges (comprising 61 galaxy pairs and 3 galaxy triplets) identified in the GOTHIC survey. We derived sérsic indices, luminosities, masses, and scalelengths of the bulges. Most bulges (105/131) are classical, with sérsic indices lying between $n=2$ and $n=8$. Among these, 64% are elliptical galaxies, while the remainder are classical bulges in disc galaxies. Only $\sim$20% of the sample exhibit pseudobulges. Bulge masses span $1.5\times10^9$ to $1.4\times10^{12}\,M_\odot$, with the most massive systems being ellipticals. Galaxy type matching shows that elliptical--elliptical (E--E) and elliptical--disc (E--D) mergers dominate over disc--disc (D--D) mergers. At least one galaxy in two-thirds of the dual AGN systems is elliptical and only $\sim$30% involve two disc galaxies. Although our sample is limited, our results suggest that dual AGN preferentially occur in evolved, red, quenched systems, that typically form via major mergers. They are predominantly hosted in classical bulges or elliptical galaxies rather than star-forming disc galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 We present jorbit, a python/JAX library designed to enable modern data-driven numerical studies of the solar system. Written entirely in JAX, an auto-differentiable and optionally GPU accelerated language behind many current large-scale machine learning efforts, jorbit includes an independent implementation of REBOUND's IAS15 integrator and the ability to parse precomputed ephemerides such as the JPL DE series. In its default behavior, jorbit maintains ~1 mas agreement with JPL Horizons on ~decade timescales for typical main-belt asteroids, enabling it to fully capitalize on high-precision astrometry and ranging data. We include details of the code's implementation and several worked examples, including illustrations of jorbit's ability to simulate N-body systems, forward model astrometric data, fit orbits, replicate the Minor Planet Center's "MPChecker" service, and contribute to modeling the effect of minor planets on stellar light curves.

 - **Abstract**
 Over the past decades, significant efforts have been devoted to developing sophisticated algorithms for automatically identifying and classifying radio sources in large surveys. However, even the most advanced methods face challenges in recognising complex radio structures and accurately associating radio emission with their host galaxies. Leveraging data from the ASKAP telescope and the Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) survey, Radio Galaxy Zoo EMU (RGZ EMU) was created to generate high-quality radio source classifications for training deep learning models and cataloging millions of radio sources in the southern sky. By integrating novel machine learning techniques, including anomaly detection and natural language processing, our workflow actively engages citizen scientists to enhance classification accuracy. We present results from Phase I of the project and discuss how these data will contribute to improving open science catalogues like EMUCAT.
#### DARKSKIES: A suite of super-sampled zoom-in simulations of galaxy clusters with self-interacting dark matter

 - **Abstract**
 We present the "DARKSKIES" suite of one hundred, zoom-in hydrodynamic simulations of massive ($M_{200}>5\times10^{14}{\rm M}_\odot)$ galaxy clusters with self-interacting dark matter (SIDM). We super-sample the simulations such that $m_{\rm DM}/m_{\rm gas}\sim0.1$, enabling us to simulate a dark matter particle mass of $m=0.68\times10^{8}M_\odot$ an order of magnitude faster, whilst exploring SIDM in the core of clusters at extremely high resolution. We calibrate the baryonic feedback to produce observationally consistent and realistic galaxy clusters across all simulations and simulate five models of velocity-independent SIDM targeting the expected sensitivity of future telescopes - $\sigma_{\rm DM}/m=0.,0.01,0.05,0.1,0.2$ cm$^2$/g. We find the density profiles exhibit the characteristic core even in the smallest of cross-sections, with cores developing only at late times ($z<0.5$). We investigate the dynamics of the brightest cluster galaxy inside the dark matter halo and find in SIDM cosmologies there exists a so-called wobbling not observed in collisionless dark matter. We find this wobble is driven by accreting mass on to a cored density profile with the signal peaking at $z=0.25$ and dropping thereafter. This finding is further supported by the existence of an anti-correlation between the offset between the BCG and the dark matter halo and its relative velocity in SIDM only, a hallmark of harmonic oscillation.
#### Fitting the Shadows: Star Formation Scaling Relations in the Low Surface Brightness Regime

 - **Abstract**
 Classical low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies pose an important challenge to galaxy evolution models. While they are found to host large reservoirs of atomic hydrogen, they display low stellar and star-formation surface densities. Global star formation scaling relations characterize trends in the star formation behaviour of galaxies; when used to compare populations or classes of galaxies, deviations in the observed trends can be used to probe predicted differences in physical conditions. In this work we utilize the well-studied Star Forming Main Sequence and integrated Kennicutt-Schmidt Relations to characterize star formation in the LSB regime, and compare the observed trends to relations for a normal star-forming galaxies. Using a comprehensive cross-matched sample of 277 LSB galaxies from the GALEX-SDSS-WISE Legacy Catalog Release 2 and the Arecibo Legacy Fast Arecibo L-band Feed Array Catalog, we gain an in-depth view of the star formation process in the LSB regime. HI-selected LSB galaxies follow very similar trends in atomic gas-to-stellar mass ratio and the star forming main sequence to their high surface brightness counterparts. However, while LSB galaxies host comparably large atomic gas reservoirs, they prove to be largely inefficient in converting this gas to stars with a median depletion time $t_{dep} \approx 18$ Gyr. These results are discussed in relation to previous studies which find that LSB galaxies host low atomic gas densities and are largely deficient in molecular gas, which suggest that the faint appearance of LSB galaxies may be the result of physical conditions on the sub-kpc scale.

 - **Abstract**
 Perturbations in the cosmic neutrino background produce a characteristic phase shift in the acoustic oscillations imprinted in the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), providing a unique observational probe of neutrino physics. In this work, we explore how this phase shift signature is altered in the presence of neutrino interactions with temperature-dependent scattering rates, motivated by physical constructions for neutrino self-interactions and neutrino-dark matter couplings. A key finding is that the phase shift in these realistic models -- characterized by gradual rather than instantaneous decoupling -- maintains the same functional form as the free-streaming template, with only the asymptotic amplitude decreasing for stronger interactions that delay decoupling. This simple parametrization enables us to directly constrain neutrino interactions through phase shift measurements in the temperature and polarization power spectra from CMB observations. Analyzing the latest data from \textit{Planck}, the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, and the South Pole Telescope, we derive strong constraints on the neutrino decoupling redshift. Our global analysis indicates that neutrinos have been freely streaming since deep within the radiation-dominated epoch. We also explore flavor-dependent scenarios in which only one neutrino species interacts. Overall, our work establishes a signature-driven framework that exploits the clean phase shift signal in the acoustic oscillations of the CMB as a precise and robust probe of non-standard neutrino interactions in the early universe.
