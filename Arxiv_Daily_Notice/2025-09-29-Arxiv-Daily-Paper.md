 - **Abstract**
 The Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) is an international observatory currently under construction, which will consist of two sites (one in the Northern Hemisphere and one in the Southern Hemisphere). It will eventually be the largest and most sensitive ground-based gamma-ray observatory. In the meantime, a small subarray composed of four Large-Sized Telescopes (LSTs) at the Northern site will begin collecting data in the coming year. In preparation, we present a stereoscopic event reconstruction using graph neural networks (GNNs) to combine information from several telescopes of this subarray. In our previous work, we explored the use of GNNs for the stereoscopic reconstruction of gamma-ray events on simulated data from the Prod5 sample and showed that GNNs provide a better stereoscopic reconstruction. We now compare this approach to the currently foreseen method that analytically combines the output of monoscopic random forests, and explore how GNNs can be used in fusion with the Random forest algorithm in order to provide a more sensitive stereoscopic system.

 - **Abstract**
 We present ARCH (Adaptive Reconstruction of Cluster Halos), a new gravitational lensing pipeline for cluster mass reconstruction that applies a joint shear-flexion analysis to JWST imaging. Previous approaches have explored joint shear+flexion reconstructions through forward modeling and Bayesian inference frameworks; in contrast, ARCH adopts a staged optimization strategy that incrementally filters and selects candidate halos rather than requiring a global likelihood model or strong priors. This design makes reconstruction computationally tractable and flexible, enabling systematic tests of multiple signal combinations within a unified framework. ARCH employs staged candidate generation, local optimization, filtering, forward selection, and global strength refinement, with a combined fit metric weighted by per-signal uncertainties. Applies to Abell 2744 and El Gordo, the pipeline recovers convergence maps and subcluster masses consistent with published weak+strong lensing results. In Abell 2744 the central core mass within 300$h^{-1}$ kpc is $2.1\times 10^{14} M_\odot h^{-1}$, while in El Gordo the northwestern and southeastern clumps are recovered at $2.6\times 10^{14} M_\odot h^{-1}$ and $2.3\times 10^{14} M_\odot h^{-1}$. Jackknife resampling indicates typical 1$\sigma$ uncertainties of $10^{12}-10^{13} M_\odot h^{-1}$, with the all signal and shear+$\mathcal{F}$ reconstructions providing the most stable results. These results demonstrate that flexion, when anchored by shear, enhances sensitivity to cluster substructure while maintaining stable cluster-scale mass recovery.
#### Modified Cosmology or Modified Galaxy Astrophysics is Driving the z>6 JWST Results? CMB Experiments can discover the Origin in Near Future

 - **Abstract**
 The massive and bright galaxies observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) at high redshifts ($z > 6$) have challenged our understanding of the Universe. This may require revisiting the physics of galaxy formation and evolution, or modifying the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model to explain these observations, or both. We show that high-resolution CMB experiments such as the Simons Observatory (or CMB-S4) can measure smoking-gun signatures jointly in weak lensing and kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) power spectra, which can shed light on both these scenarios. An increase in the matter power spectrum at small scales will enhance the number density of dark matter halos at high redshifts, thereby increasing the galaxy formation rate. This will cause enhanced weak lensing signal from these redshifts and also lead to enhanced patchy-kSZ signal from the epoch of reionization. However, if only galaxy astrophysics is modified, without any modification in the matter power spectrum, then the patchy-kSZ signal gets altered, while the weak lensing signal remains nearly unaltered. We show that we can measure the modified astrophysical and cosmological scenarios at a statistical significance of $6.2\sigma$ (and $17.4\sigma$) from Simons Observatory (and CMB-S4), which will enable a conclusive understanding on what physical process is driving the high-redshift observations of JWST.

 - **Abstract**
 Hydrogen is the most abundant element in our Universe. The first generation of stars and galaxies produced photons that ionized hydrogen gas, driving a cosmological event known as the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). The upcoming Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO) will map the distribution of neutral hydrogen during this era, aiding in the study of the properties of these first-generation objects. Extracting astrophysical information will be challenging, as SKAO will produce a tremendous amount of data where the hydrogen signal will be contaminated with undesired foreground contamination and instrumental systematics. To address this, we develop the latest deep learning techniques to extract information from the 2D power spectra of the hydrogen signal expected from SKAO. We apply a series of neural network models to these measurements and quantify their ability to predict the history of cosmic hydrogen reionization, which is connected to the increasing number and efficiency of early photon sources. We show that the study of the early Universe benefits from modern deep learning technology. In particular, we demonstrate that dedicated machine learning algorithms can achieve more than a $0.95$ $R^2$ score on average in recovering the reionization history. This enables accurate and precise cosmological and astrophysical inference of structure formation in the early Universe.
#### The impact of cosmic filaments on the abundance of satellite galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 The impact of cosmic web environments on galaxy properties plays a critical role in understanding galaxy formation. Using the state-of-the-art cosmological simulation IllustrisTNG, we investigate how satellite galaxy abundance differs between filaments and the field, with filaments identified using the DisPerSE algorithm. When filaments are identified using galaxies as tracers, we find that, across all magnitude bins, central galaxies in filaments tend to host more satellite galaxies than their counterparts in the field, in qualitative agreement with observational results from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The average ratios between satellite luminosity functions in filaments and the field are $3.49$, $2.61$, and $1.90$ in the central galaxy $r$-band magnitude bins of $M_{r, {\rm cen}} \sim -22$, $-21$, and $-20$, respectively. We show that much of this excess can be attributed to the higher host halo masses of galaxies in filaments. After resampling central galaxies in both environments to match the halo mass distributions within each magnitude bin, the satellite abundance enhancement in filaments is reduced by up to $79 \%$. Additionally, the choice of tracers used to identify filaments introduces a significant bias: when filaments are identified using the dark matter density field, the environmental difference in satellite abundance is reduced by more than $70 \%$; after further resampling in both magnitude and halo mass, the difference is further suppressed by another $\sim 60$--$95 \%$. Our results highlight the importance of halo mass differences and tracer choice biases when interpreting and understanding the impact of environment on satellite galaxy properties.
#### AGN spectral variability across activity states and searches for axion-like particles

 - **Abstract**
 Axion-like particles (ALPs) are compelling candidates for dark matter and potential portals to new physics beyond the Standard Model. Photons traversing magnetized regions can convert into ALPs, producing characteristic, energy-dependent absorption features in astrophysical spectra. The probability of such conversions depends sensitively on both the photon energy and the properties of the intervening magnetic fields. Most existing searches have focused on individual astrophysical sources, but uncertainties in the structure and strength of cosmic magnetic fields have limited their reach. Recently, we have demonstrated that active galactic nuclei (AGNs) observed through galaxy clusters provide especially promising targets for ALP searches. By stacking multiple AGN-cluster sightlines, one can average over poorly known magnetic field configurations in galaxy clusters and recover a distinctive ALP-induced spectral suppression, thereby significantly enhancing sensitivity. In this work, we investigate a possible systematic uncertainty in such analyses: the intrinsic time-variability of AGN spectra. We demonstrate that AGN flux variability is correlated with spectral hardness, and that time-averaging over flaring and quiescent states can potentially mimic the suppression features imprinted by ALP-photon mixing. Our findings imply that the recent constraints remain conservative, and that incorporating detailed spectral variability into stacking analyses can further sharpen the search for axion-like particles.
#### halox: Dark matter halo properties and large-scale structure calculations using JAX
 - **Authors:** Florian Kéruzoré

 - **Abstract**
 Dark matter halos are fundamental structures in cosmology, forming the gravitational potential wells hosting galaxies and clusters of galaxies. Their properties and statistical distribution (including the halo mass function) are invaluable tools to infer the fundamental properties of the Universe. The \texttt{halox} package is a JAX-powered Python library enabling differentiable and accelerated computations of key properties of dark matter halos, and of the halo mass function. The automatic differentiation capabilities of \texttt{halox} enable its usage in gradient-based workflows, e.g. in efficient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling or machine learning applications.
#### Overview of the ESCAPE Dark Matter Test Science Project for Astronomers

 - **Abstract**
 The search for dark matter has been ongoing for decades within both astrophysics and particle physics. Both fields have employed different approaches and conceived a variety of methods for constraining the properties of dark matter, but have done so in relative isolation of one another. From an astronomer's perspective, it can be challenging to interpret the results of dark matter particle physics experiments and how these results apply to astrophysical scales. Over the past few years, the ESCAPE Dark Matter Test Science Project has been developing tools to aid the particle physics community in constraining dark matter properties; however, ESCAPE itself also aims to foster collaborations between research disciplines. This is especially important in the search for dark matter, as while particle physics is concerned with detecting the particles themselves, all of the evidence for its existence lies solely within astrophysics and cosmology. Here, we present a short review of the progress made by the Dark Matter Test Science Project and their applications to existing experiments, with a view towards how this project can foster complementary with astrophysical observations.
