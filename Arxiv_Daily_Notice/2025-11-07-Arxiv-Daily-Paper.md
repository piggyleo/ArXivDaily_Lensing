#### Dynamical Friction Constraints on the Dark Matter Hypothesis Across Astronomical Scales
 - **Authors:** X. Hernandez (UNAM), Pavel Kroupa (Bonn. Prague)

 - **Abstract**
 Dynamical friction implies a consistency check on any system where dark matter particles are hypothesised to explain orbital dynamics requiring more mass under Newtonian gravity than is directly detectable. Introducing the assumption of a dominant dark matter halo will also imply a decay timescale for the orbits in question. A self-consistency constraint hence arises, such that the resulting orbital decay timescales must be longer than the lifetimes of the systems in question. While such constraints are often trivially passed, the combined dependencies of dynamical friction timescales on the mass and orbital radius of the orbital tracer and on the density and velocity dispersion of the assumed dark matter particles leads to the existence of a number of astronomical systems where such a consistency test is failed. Here, we review cases from stars in ultrafaint dwarf galaxies, galactic bars, satellite galaxies, and, particularly, the multi-period mutual orbits of the Magellanic Clouds, as recently inferred from the star formation histories of these two galaxies, as well as the nearby M81 group of galaxies, where introducing enough dark matter to explain observed kinematics leads to dynamical friction orbital decay timescales shorter than the lifetimes of the systems in question. Taken together, these observations exclude dark matter halos made of particles as plausible explanations for the observed kinematics of these systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Gas accretion, hot ($\sim 10^6\,{\rm K}$) atmospheres, and a tilt between the rotation axes of the disc and the atmosphere are all robust predictions of standard cosmology for massive star-forming galaxies at low redshift. Using idealized hydrodynamic simulations, we demonstrate that the central regions of hot galaxy atmospheres continuously condense into cool ($\sim10^4\,{\rm K}$) discs, while being replenished by an inflow from larger scales. The size and orientation of the condensed disc are determined by the angular momentum of the atmosphere, so it is large and often tilted with respect to the pre-existing galaxy disc. Continuous smooth accretion from hot atmospheres can thus both provide the necessary fuel for star formation and explain the observed ubiquity of extended and warped HI discs around local spirals. In this hot accretion scenario, cool gas observations cannot be used to trace the source of the HI, warps out to halo radii, consistent with recent indications of a lack of $21\,{\rm cm}$ emission from the halos of nearby galaxies (the `HI desert'). Observations of HI warps formed via hot accretion can be used to constrain the angular momentum, accretion rate, and gas metallicity of hot galaxy atmospheres, important parameters for disc galaxy evolution that are hard to determine by other means.
#### Dark Matter in White Dwarfs: Implications for Their Structure
 - **Authors:** Sílvia P. Nunes, José D. V. Arbañil, Juan M. Z. Pretel, Sérgio B. Duarte

 - **Abstract**
 White Dwarfs (WDs), the final evolutionary stage of most stars, are frequently modeled considering only a dense plasma matter. However, their potential interaction with dark matter (DM), especially in galactic halos where DM is expected to be prevalent, may lead to significant consequences. This work proposes a novel EoS (EoS) that consistently incorporates both hot dense plasma and cold dark matter (CDM) contributions in hot WDs. The hot dense plasma EoS is extended to include thermal and radiative contributions. At the same time, the CDM component is modeled as a linear fluid, with the coupling constant $\alpha$ determined self-consistently within the star. A smooth phase transition between hot dense plasma and CDM regimes is introduced via a hyperbolic mixing function that depends on local energy density and stellar temperature. Our results show that the inclusion of CDM leads to an increase in the WD radius by approximately $12\%$ and a total mass enhancement of $0.7\%$, compared to standard hot WD models without lattice effects. These results highlight the importance of considering CDM in stellar modeling and suggest that WDs may serve as indirect probes for the astrophysical properties of dark matter.
#### Making the most of pure parallels: Machine learning augmented photometric redshifts for sparse JWST filter sets
 - **Authors:** Kenneth J. Duncan
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03802

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.03802

 - **Abstract**
 Photometric redshifts (photo-$z$s) are an essential tool for galaxy evolution science with JWST. However, for deep surveys with more limited filter sets (i.e. $N_{\text{filt}} \sim6$) such as large pure parallel surveys, the most commonly used template-fitting based photo-$z$ approaches can yield highly confident but spurious results for high-$z$ populations of interest. The utility and legacy value of these datasets could therefore be negatively impacted. To address this challenge, we present an application of machine learning (ML) based photo-$z$ techniques to deep JWST photometric datasets. We employ two different ML algorithms, using Gaussian processes and nearest-neighbour estimates, alongside a more standard template fitting approach. We show that simple nearest-neighbour based estimates can provide more accurate photo-$z$s than template fitting out to $z\sim8$, as well as reducing the fraction of catastrophic outliers by a factor of $\sim2-3$. Additionally, `hybrid' estimates combining template and ML can yield further improvements in overall accuracy and reliability while retaining some ability to predict photo-$z$ out to $z > 10$. The nearest-neighbour only or hybrid estimates can achieve photo-$z$s with robust scatter of $\sigma_{\text{NMAD}}\sim0.03-0.04$ and outlier fractions of $\sim3-10\%$ between $0 < z \lesssim 8$ from just 6 NIRCam bands, with negligible additional computational costs compared to standard template fitting. Our methodology is easily adaptable to alternative datasets, filter combinations or training samples. Overall, our results highlight the potential for even simple ML techniques to enhance the scientific return of JWST pure parallel and wide-area surveys.
#### Event Reconstruction for Radio-Based In-Ice Neutrino Detectors with Neural Posterior Estimation

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03910

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.03910

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of ultra-high-energy (UHE) neutrinos in the EeV range is the goal of current and future in-ice radio arrays at the South Pole and in Greenland. Here, we present a deep neural network that can reconstruct the main neutrino properties of interest from the raw waveforms recorded by the radio antennas: the neutrino direction, the energy of the particle shower induced by the neutrino interaction, and the event topology, thereby estimating the neutrino flavor. For the first time, we predict the full posterior PDF for the energy and direction reconstruction via neural posterior estimation utilizing conditional normalizing flows, enabling event-by-event uncertainty prediction. We improve over previous reconstruction algorithms and obtain a median resolution of 0.30 log(E) and 18 square degrees for a 'shallow' detector component and 0.08 log(E) and 28 square degrees for a 'deep' detector component for neutral current (NC) events at a shower energy of 1 EeV. This deep learning approach also allows us to reconstruct the more stochastic $\nu_e$ - charged current (CC) events. We quantify the impact of different antenna types and systematic uncertainties on the reconstruction and derive a goodness-of-fit score to test the compatibility of measured neutrino signals with the Monte Carlo simulations used to train the neural network.
#### Revealing Hidden Cosmic Flows through the Zone of Avoidance with Deep Learning
 - **Authors:** Alexandra Dupuy, Donghui Jeong, Sungwook E. Hong, Ho Seong Hwang, Juhan Kim, Hélène M. Courtois

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03919

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.03919

 - **Abstract**
 We present a refined deep-learning-based method to reconstruct the three-dimensional dark matter density, gravitational potential, and peculiar velocity fields in the Zone of Avoidance (ZOA), a region near the galactic plane with limited observational data. Using a convolutional neural network (V-Net) trained on A-SIM simulation data, our approach reconstructs density or potential fields from galaxy positions and radial peculiar velocities. The full 3D peculiar velocity field is then derived from the reconstructed potential. We validate the method with mocks that mimic the spatial distribution of the Cosmicflows-4 (CF4) catalog and apply it to actual data. Given CF4's significant observational uncertainties and since our model does not yet account for them, we use peculiar velocities corrected via an existing Hamiltonian Monte Carlo reconstruction, rather than raw catalog distances. Our results demonstrate that the reconstructed density field recovers known galaxy clusters detected in an H \textsc{i} survey of the ZOA, despite this dataset not being used in the reconstruction. This agreement underscores the potential of our method to reveal structures in data-sparse regions. Most notably, streamline convergence and watershed analysis identify a mass concentration consistent with the Great Attractor, at $(l, b) = (308.4^\circ \pm 2.4^\circ, 29.0^\circ \pm 1.9^\circ)$ and $cz = 4960.1 \pm 404.4,{\rm km/s}$, for 64\% of realizations. Our method is particularly valuable as it does not rely on data point density, enabling accurate reconstruction in data-sparse regions and offering strong potential for future surveys with more extensive galaxy datasets.
#### Ultra-Diffuse, Ultra-Different: Observed vs. Simulated Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies Live in Fundamentally Different Halos

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we compare galaxies from the NIHAO and HESTIA simulation suites to ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) with spectroscopically measured dynamical masses. For each observed UDG, we identify the simulated dark matter halo that best matches its dynamical mass. In general, observed UDGs are matched to simulated galaxies with lower stellar masses than they are observed to have. These simulated galaxies also have halo masses much less than would be expected given the observed UDG's stellar mass and the stellar mass -- halo mass relationship. We use the recently established relation between globular cluster (GC) number and halo mass, which has been shown to be applicable to UDGs, to better constrain their observed halo masses. This method indicates that observed UDGs reside in relatively massive dark matter halos. This creates a striking discrepancy: the simulated UDGs are matched to the dynamical masses of observed ones, but not their total halo masses. In other words, simulations can produce UDGs in halos with the correct inner dynamics, but not with the massive halos implied by GC counts. We explore several possible explanations for this tension, from both the observational and theoretical sides. We propose that the most likely resolution is that observed UDGs may have fundamentally different dark matter halo profiles than those produced in NIHAO and HESTIA. This highlights the need for a simulation that self-consistently produces galaxies of a stellar mass of $\sim 10^8 M_\odot$ in dark matter halos that exhibit the full range of large dark matter cores to cuspy NFW-like halos.

 - **Abstract**
 We present CosmicANNEstimator (Cosmological Parameters Artificial Neural Network Estimator), a machine learning approach for constraining cosmological parameters within the Lambda Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) framework. Our methodology employs two specialized artificial neural networks (ANNs) designed to analyze Hubble parameter and Supernova data independently. The estimator is trained on synthetic data covering broad parameter ranges, with Gaussian random noise incorporated to simulate observational uncertainties. Our results demonstrate parameter estimates and associated uncertainties comparable to traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, establishing machine learning as an efficient alternative for cosmological parameter estimation. This work underscores the potential of neural network-based inference to complement traditional Bayesian methods and accelerate future cosmological analyses.

 - **Abstract**
 In our alternative theory, built around the coincidence of experimental and theoretical data, three "free" parameters -- the magnetic field in the tachocline of the order of ~10^7 G (see Fig.(A.1) and Eq.(A17) in V. D. Rusov et al. (2021)), the axion mass ma ~3.2*10^{-2} eV (see Eq. (11) in V. D. Rusov et al. (2021)), and the asymmetric dark matter (ADM) in the Universe with mADM ~5 GeV ((see V. D. Rusov et al. (2021); A. C. Vincent et al. (2016)) -- give a complete solution to the problem of the theory of magnetic flux tubes in strong fields with 11-year variations of axion-origin photons, which are caused by and anticorrelated to the 11-year variations in density of ADM, gravitationally captured on the Sun.

 - **Abstract**
 The approaches to searching for axion-like signals based on pulsars include observations with pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) and pulsar polarization arrays (PPAs). However, these methods are limited by observational uncertainties arising from multiple unknown and periodic physical effects, which substantially complicate subsequent data analysis. To mitigate these issues and improve data fidelity, we propose the Artificial Pulsar Polarization Arrays (APPA): a satellite network comprising multiple pulsed signal transmitters and a dedicated receiver satellite. In order to constrain the axion-photon coupling parameter $g_{a\gamma}$, we generate simulated observations using Monte Carlo methods to investigate APPA's sensitivity via two complementary approaches: Bayesian analysis and frequentist analysis. Simulations indicate that for axion mass $m_{a}\sim\mathcal{O}\big(10^{-22}-10^{-19}\big)$ eV, APPA yields a better upper limit on $g_{a\gamma}$ (at the 95\% confidence level) than conventional ground-based observations and achieves better detection sensitivity.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations from JWST have revealed unexpectedly luminous galaxies, exhibiting stellar masses and luminosities significantly higher than predicted by theoretical models at Cosmic Dawn. In this study, we present a suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations targeting high-redshift ($z \geq 10$) galaxies with dark matter halo masses in the range $10^{10} - 10^{11}\ {\rm M}_{\odot}$ at $z=10$, using state-of-the-art galaxy formation simulation codes (Enzo, Ramses, Changa, Gadget-3, Gadget-4, and Gizmo). This study aims to evaluate the convergence of the participating codes and their reproducibility of high-redshift galaxies with the galaxy formation model calibrated at relatively low redshift, without additional physics for high-redshift environments. The subgrid physics follows the AGORA CosmoRun framework, with adjustments to resolution and initial conditions to emulate similar physical environments in the early universe. The participating codes show consistent results for key galaxy properties (e.g., stellar mass), but also reveal notable differences (e.g., metallicity), indicating that galaxy properties at high redshifts are highly sensitive to the feedback implementation of the simulation. Massive halos (${\rm M}_{\rm halo}\geq5\times10^{10}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$ at $z=10$) succeed in reproducing observed stellar masses, metallicities, and UV luminosities at $10\leq z\leq12$ without requiring additional subgrid physics, but tend to underpredict those properties at higher redshift. We also find that varying the dust-to-metal ratio modestly affects UV luminosity of simulated galaxies, whereas the absence of dust significantly enhances it. In future work, higher-resolution simulations will be conducted to better understand the formation and evolution of galaxies at Cosmic Dawn.

 - **Abstract**
 Data-driven approaches using deep learning are emerging as powerful techniques to extract non-Gaussian information from cosmological large-scale structure. This work presents the first simulation-based inference (SBI) pipeline that combines weak lensing and galaxy clustering maps in a realistic Dark Energy Survey Year 3 (DES Y3) configuration and serves as preparation for a forthcoming analysis of the survey data. We develop a scalable forward model based on the CosmoGridV1 suite of N-body simulations to generate over one million self-consistent mock realizations of DES Y3 at the map level. Leveraging this large dataset, we train deep graph convolutional neural networks on the full survey footprint in spherical geometry to learn low-dimensional features that approximately maximize mutual information with target parameters. These learned compressions enable neural density estimation of the implicit likelihood via normalizing flows in a ten-dimensional parameter space spanning cosmological $w$CDM, intrinsic alignment, and linear galaxy bias parameters, while marginalizing over baryonic, photometric redshift, and shear bias nuisances. To ensure robustness, we extensively validate our inference pipeline using synthetic observations derived from both systematic contaminations in our forward model and independent Buzzard galaxy catalogs. Our forecasts yield significant improvements in cosmological parameter constraints, achieving $2-3\times$ higher figures of merit in the $\Omega_m - S_8$ plane relative to our implementation of baseline two-point statistics and effectively breaking parameter degeneracies through probe combination. These results demonstrate the potential of SBI analyses powered by deep learning for upcoming Stage-IV wide-field imaging surveys.
