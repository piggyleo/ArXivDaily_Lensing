 - **Abstract**
 The 21-cm signal from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) is a powerful probe of the evolution of the Universe. However, accurate measurements of the EoR signal from radio interferometric observations are sensitive to efficient foreground removal, mitigating radio-frequency interference and accounting for instrumental systematics. This work represents the first in a series of papers, where we will be introducing a novel ML based pipeline, step-by-step, to directly infer reionization parameters from 21-cm radio-interferometric images. In this paper, we investigate the impact of the variations in the point spread function (PSF) on parameter estimation by simulating visibilities corresponding to input 21-cm maps as observed by the 128-antenna configuration of the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) Phase II. These visibilities are imaged to obtain dirty images, which are then used to train a 2D convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict $\rm x_{HI}$. To systematically assess the effect of PSF mis-modelling, we generate multiple test sets by varying the MWA's antenna layout, thereby introducing controlled variations in the PSF; we then feed these alternative PSF dirty images to our CNN trained using only dirty images with the PSF of the true antenna layout. Our results demonstrate that PSF variations introduce biases in the CNN's predictions of $\rm x_{HI}$, with errors depending on the extent of PSF distortion. We quantify these biases and discuss their implications for the reliability of machine-learning-based parameter inference in 21-cm cosmology and how they can be utilized to improve the robustness of estimation against PSF-related systematics in future 21-cm surveys. In concluding, we also discuss how this approach to incorporating realistic instrument error into an ML analysis pipeline can be expanded to include multiple other effects.

 - **Abstract**
 We present new Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging of three recently discovered star-forming dwarf galaxies beyond the Local Group: Pavo, Corvus A, and Kamino. The discovery of Kamino is reported here for the first time. They rank among the most isolated faint dwarf galaxies known, hence they provide unique opportunities to study galaxy evolution at the smallest scales, free from environmental effects of more massive galaxies. Our HST data reach $\sim$2-4 magnitudes below the tip of the red giant branch for each dwarf, allowing us to measure their distances, structural properties, and recent star formation histories (SFHs). All three galaxies contain a complex stellar population of young and old stars, and are typical of field galaxies in this mass regime ($M_V=-10.62\pm0.08$ and $D=2.16^{+0.08}_{-0.07}$ Mpc for Pavo, $M_V=-10.91\pm0.10$ and $D=3.34\pm0.11$ Mpc for Corvus A, and $M_V=-12.02\pm0.12$ and $D=6.50^{+0.15}_{-0.11}$ Mpc for Kamino). Our HST-derived SFHs reveal differences among the three dwarfs: Pavo and Kamino show relatively steady, continuous star formation, while Corvus A formed $\sim$$60$% of its stellar mass by 10 Gyr ago. These results align with theoretical predictions of diverse evolutionary pathways for isolated low-mass galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 The impact of energy exchange among the relevant fluid components: baryonic matter, fermionic dark matter (DM), and dark energy (DE) on the internal structure of neutron stars is investigated. Using a representative DM mass $m_{\chi} = 10$ GeV and a barotropic DE relation, we add source terms Qi to the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations and examine three cases: (i) noninteracting fluids (Model I), (ii) fully interacting baryon plus DM and DM with DE fluids with optional DM self repulsion (Model II), and (iii) a unified dark sector coupled to baryons (Model III). Two effects dominate: softening by massive, pressure-poor DM, and additional softening/ and binding from DE with negative pressures. Model I isolates these baselines. In Model II, exchange terms self regulate, making the mass radius curves nearly independent of the coupling parameter $\alpha$ for nearly five orders of magnitude. Model III breaks this $\alpha$ degeneracy: a sizable vacuum fraction suppresses the baryonic pressure gradient, reducing both the maximum mass and radii, whereas a pure-DM core is less sensitive. We outline when dark interactions can leave observable, macroscopic imprints.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxies with high star-formation rate surface densities often host large-scale outflows that redistribute energy, momentum, and baryons between the interstellar medium and the halo, making them a key feedback channel regulating galaxy evolution. Despite their importance, the driving physics behind galactic outflows and their interaction with the surrounding halo is yet to be fully understood. In particular, the influence of a pre-existing reservoir of cosmic rays (CRs) in galaxy halos has not been clearly established. We determine the conditions required to launch outflows in the presence of halo CRs and investigate how CR pressure gradients modify outflow speeds. We find that CR halos suppress the development of large-scale, CR-driven winds and redirect CR feedback toward local recycling flows. Slow outflows are therefore more likely in young galaxies lacking extended CR halos, while fast winds in intense starbursts are dominated by momentum injection and largely unaffected by halo CRs.

 - **Abstract**
 A galaxy's mid-IR spectrum encodes key information on its radiation field, star formation, and dust properties. Characterizing this spectrum therefore offers strong constraints on a galaxy's activity. This project describes a diagnostic tool for identifying main-sequence (MS) star-forming galaxies (SFGs) in the local Universe using IR dust emission features that are characteristic of galaxy activity. A physically-motivated sample of mock galaxy spectra has been generated to simulate the IR emission of SFGs. Using this sample, we developed a diagnostic tool for identifying MS SFGs based on machine learning methods. Custom photometric bands were defined to target dust emission features, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and the dust continuum. Three bands were chosen to trace PAH features at 6.2 {\mu}m, 7.7 {\mu}m, 8.6 {\mu}m, and 11.3 {\mu}m, along with an additional band to probe the radiation field strength responsible for heating the dust. This diagnostic was subsequently applied to observed galaxies to evaluate its effectiveness in real-world applications. Our diagnostic achieves high performance, with an accuracy of 90.9% on MS SFGs (observed sample of SFGs). Additionally, it shows low contamination, with only 16.2% of AGN galaxies being misidentified as SF. Combining observational data with stellar population synthesis models enables the creation of physically-motivated samples of SFGs that match the spectral properties of real galaxies. By positioning custom photometric bands targeting key dust features, our diagnostic can extract valuable information without the need to measure emission lines. Although PAHs are sensitive indicators of star formation and interstellar medium radiation hardness, PAH emission alone is insufficient for identifying MS SFGs. Finally, we developed a physically-motivated spectral library of MS SFGs spanning from UV to FIR wavelengths.

 - **Abstract**
 The $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmological model provides a good description of a wide range of astrophysical and cosmological observations. However, severe challenges to the phenomenological $\Lambda$CDM model have emerged recently, including the Hubble constant tension and the significant deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model reported by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration. Despite many explanations for the two challenges have been proposed, the origins of them are still intriguing mysteries. Here, we investigate the DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAOs) measurements to interpret the Hubble constant tension. Employing a non-parametric method, we find that the dark energy equation of state $w(z)$ evolves with redshift from DESI BAO data and type Ia supernovae. From the Friedmann equations, the Hubble constant ($H_0$) is derived from $w(z)$ model-independently. We find that the values of $H_0$ show a descending trend as a function of redshift, and can effectively resolve the Hubble constant tension. Our study finds that the two unexpected challenges to the $\Lambda$CDM model can be understood in one physical framework, e.g., dynamical dark energy.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we develop a Neural Likelihood Estimator and apply it to analyse real gravitational-wave (GW) data for the first time. We assess the usability of neural likelihood for GW parameter estimation and report the parameter space where neural likelihood performs as a robust estimator to output posterior probability distributions using modest computational resources. In addition, we demonstrate that the trained Neural likelihood can also be used in further analysis, enabling us to obtain the evidence corresponding to a hypothesis, making our method a complete tool for parameter estimation. Particularly, our method requires around 100 times fewer likelihood evaluations than standard Bayesian algorithms to infer properties of a GW signal from a binary black hole system as observed by current generation ground-based detectors. The fairly simple neural network architecture chosen makes for cheap training, which allows our method to be used on-the-fly without the need for special hardware and ensures our method is flexible to use any waveform model, noise model, or prior. We show results from simulations as well as results from GW150914 as proof of the effectiveness of our algorithm.

 - **Abstract**
 We present RAVEN, a newly developed vetting and validation pipeline for TESS exoplanet candidates. The pipeline employs a Bayesian framework to derive the posterior probability of a candidate being a planet against a set of False Positive (FP) scenarios, through the use of a Gradient Boosted Decision Tree and a Gaussian Process classifier, trained on comprehensive synthetic training sets of simulated planets and 8 astrophysical FP scenarios injected into TESS lightcurves. These training sets allow large scale candidate vetting and performance verification against individual FP scenarios. A Non-Simulated FP training set consisting of real TESS candidates caused primarily by stellar variability and systematic noise is also included. The machine learning derived probabilities are combined with scenario specific prior probabilities, including the candidates' positional probabilities, to compute the final posterior probabilities. Candidates with a planetary posterior probability greater than 99% against each FP scenario and whose implied planetary radius is less than 8$R_{\oplus}$ are considered to be statistically validated by the pipeline. In this first version, the pipeline has been developed for candidates with a lightcurve released from the TESS Science Processing Operations Centre, an orbital period between 0.5 and 16 days and a transit depth greater than 300ppm. The pipeline obtained area-under-curve (AUC) scores > 97% on all FP scenarios and > 99% on all but one. Testing on an independent external sample of 1361 pre-classified TOIs, the pipeline achieved an overall accuracy of 91%, demonstrating its effectiveness for automated ranking of TESS candidates. For a probability threshold of 0.9 the pipeline reached a precision of 97% with a recall score of 66% on these TOIs. The RAVEN pipeline is publicly released as a cloud-hosted app, making it easily accessible to the community.

 - **Abstract**
 Despite decades of direct and indirect searches within the Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) framework, no conclusive results have been found in the GeV--TeV range. This has motivated exploring alternatives, including new particles and macroscopic objects. Two well-motivated scenarios are sub-GeV DM and Primordial Black Holes (PBHs). Molecular clouds (MCs), typically studied as star-forming sites, can serve as astrophysical laboratories to probe these candidates via their ionization rates. Observations show ionization levels exceeding expectations from known CR fluxes, pointing to an additional ionizing component. Here, we consider electrons and positrons from annihilating and decaying MeV DM particles, as well as Hawking radiation from evaporating PBHs, as possible contributors. We model transport driven by energy losses within the clouds. By comparing predicted ionization rates with observations, conservative constraints are set on the thermally averaged cross section $\langle\sigma v\rangle$, decay lifetime $\tau$ and PBH abundances $f_{PBH}$. The analysis assumes all the observed ionization comes from DM and adopts a 95% confidence level. Results show that, even in the most conservative case of local MCs such as L1551, these constraints are very close to the most competitive bounds from X-ray observations, while inner-Galaxy clouds like DRAGON or G1.4--1.8+87 provide stronger limits, sometimes improving X-ray and cosmological constraints. For sub-GeV DM, MCs exclude parameter space competitive with the one tested by NuSTAR, INTEGRAL, or Voyager, especially below $\sim$30 MeV. In the PBH case, asteroid-mass black holes are restricted to a low fraction of DM, with optimistic scenarios getting close to the strongest limits. This demonstrates the potential of MCs as a novel probe in indirect DM searches.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy properties correlate with their position within the cosmic web. While galaxies are observed in an environment today, they may have experienced different environments in the past. The environmental history, linked to pre-processing, leaves an imprint on the properties of galaxies. We use the GAEA semi-analytic model and IllustrisTNG to reconstruct the environmental histories of galaxies between $z=0$ and $z=4$ that today reside in filaments. Our goal is to understand how galaxy properties are related to their past environments, and the role of the cosmic web in shaping their properties. We find that filament galaxies at $z=0$ are a heterogeneous mix of populations with distinct environmental histories. The vast majority of them have experienced group processing, with only $\sim$20\% remaining centrals throughout their life. For $\rm 9 < \log_{10}(M_{star}/M_{sun}) < 10$ galaxies, models confirm that the environmental effects are primarily driven by group processing: satellites stop growing stellar mass and exhibit elevated quenched fractions, whereas filament galaxies remain centrals have properties that are similar to field galaxies. Massive galaxies ($\rm \log_{10}(M_{star}/M_{sun}) > 10$) that have never been satellites and entered filaments more than 9 Gyr ago show accelerated stellar mass assembly and higher quenched fractions relative to the field, due to a higher frequency of merger events inside filaments, even at fixed mass. The most massive $\rm \log ((M_{star} / M_{sun}) > 11$) galaxies accreted onto filaments over 9 Gyr ago, highlighting the role of filaments in building up the high-mass end of the galaxy population. Filaments regulate galaxy evolution in a mass-dependent way: group environments regulate low-mass galaxies, while filaments favour the growth of massive galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy mergers are believed to play an important role in triggering rapid supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth. As merging nuclei approach each other, the physical properties of the participating galaxies and the associated SMBH growth are expected to evolve significantly. This study measures and characterizes these physical properties throughout the merger sequence. We constructed multiwavelength Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs) from hard X-rays to the far-infrared (FIR) for a sample of 72 nearby Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) host galaxies. The sample comprises 64 interacting systems, including single AGNs in mergers and dual AGNs, with nuclear separations $\leq$30 kpc, as well as eight isolated active galaxies with merging features. We carefully adapted available photometric measurements at each wavelength to account for their complex morphologies and varying spatial resolutions, to perform SED fitting using CIGALE, aimed to derive critical physical properties. Our results reveal that merging galaxies hosting AGN(s) show deviations from the star-forming main sequence, and a wide range of star formation rates (SFRs). Both AGN activity and star formation are significantly influenced by the merger process, but these effects are more prominent in major, mass ratios $<$4:1, interactions. We find that the projected nuclear separation is not a good tracer of the merger stage. Instead, morphological classification accurately assesses the merger progression. Based on this morphological analysis, late-stage mergers exhibit elevated SFRs (5.1$\times$), AGN luminosities (2.4$\times$), and nuclear obscuration (2.8$\times$) compared to earlier stages, supporting previous findings and reinforcing the link between merger-driven galaxy evolution and SMBH growth.

 - **Abstract**
 We present integral field spectroscopic observations of 75 strong gravitational lens candidates identified with a residual neural network in the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys, obtained with the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) on the ESO's Very Large Telescope. These observations are part of an ongoing effort to build a large, spectroscopically confirmed sample of strong lensing systems for studies on dark matter, galaxy structure, and cosmology. Our MUSE program targets both lens and source redshifts, with particular emphasis on southern hemisphere systems. MUSE's wide spectral coverage and integral field capability allow for efficient identification of multiple sources, lens environments, and weak spectral features. Redshifts for lenses and sources were obtained via manual identification of spectral features in extracted 1D spectra. Our dataset includes systems with complex configurations, such as multiple source planes and group or cluster-scale environments. We extracted and analyzed 185 spectra, successfully determining both the lens and the source redshifts for 48 gravitational lens systems. For an additional 21 targets, we measured the redshifts of the lenses but were unable to determine the redshifts of the background sources. Six targets were confirmed to not be gravitational lenses. The results presented here complement space-based imaging from our HST SNAPshot program and spectroscopic follow-up with DESI and Keck, and have lasting legacy value for identifying interesting high-redshift sources and complex lensing configurations.

 - **Abstract**
 We present spectroscopic data of strong lenses and their source galaxies using the Keck Near-Infrared Echellette Spectrometer (NIRES) and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), providing redshifts necessary for nearly all strong-lensing applications with these systems, especially the extraction of physical parameters from lensing modeling. These strong lenses were found in the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys using Residual Neural Networks (ResNet) and followed up by our Hubble Space Telescope program, with all systems displaying unambiguous lensed arcs. With NIRES, we target eight lensed sources at redshifts difficult to measure in the optical range and determine the source redshifts for six, between $z_s$ = 1.675 and 3.332. DESI observed one of the remaining source redshifts, as well as an additional source redshift within the six systems. The two systems with non-detections by NIRES were observed for a considerably shorter 600s at high airmass. Combining NIRES infrared spectroscopy with optical spectroscopy from our DESI Strong Lensing Secondary Target Program, these results provide the complete lens and source redshifts for six systems, a resource for refining automated strong lens searches in future deep- and wide-field imaging surveys and addressing a range of questions in astrophysics and cosmology.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Strong Lensing Secondary Target Program. This is a spectroscopic follow-up program for strong gravitational lens candidates found in the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys footprint. Spectroscopic redshifts for the lenses and lensed source are crucial for lens modeling to obtain physical parameters. The spectroscopic catalog in this paper consists of 73 candidate systems from the DESI Early Data Release (EDR). We have confirmed 20 strong lensing systems and determined four to not be lenses. For the remaining systems, more spectroscopic data from ongoing and future observations will be presented in future publications. We discuss the implications of our results for lens searches with neural networks in existing and future imaging surveys as well as for lens modeling. This Strong Lensing Secondary Target Program is part of the DESI Strong Lens Foundry project, and this is Paper II of a series on this project.
