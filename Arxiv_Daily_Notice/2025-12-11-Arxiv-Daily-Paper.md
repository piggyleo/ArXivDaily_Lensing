 - **Abstract**
 Context. The internal structure of the intracluster medium (ICM) is tightly linked to the assembly history and physical processes in groups and clusters, but the role of recent accretion in shaping these profiles has not been fully explored. Aims. We investigate to what extent mass accretion accounts for the variability in ICM density and thermodynamic profiles, and what can present-day structures reveal about their formation histories. Methods. We analyze a hydrodynamical cosmological simulation including gas cooling but no feedback, to isolate the effects of heating from structure formation. Median profiles of ICM quantities are introduced as a robust description of the bulk ICM. We then examine correlations between mass accretion rates or assembly indicators with the profiles of temperature, entropy, pressure, gas and dark-matter density, as well as their scatter. Results. Accretion in the last dynamical time strongly lowers central gas densities, while leaving dark matter largely unaffected, producing a distinct signature in the baryon depletion function. Pressure and entropy show the clearest dependence on accretion, whereas temperature is less sensitive. The radii of steepest entropy, temperature, and pressure shift inward by $\sim (10-20)\%$ between high- and low-accretion subsamples. Assembly-state indicators are also related to the location of these features, and accretion correlates with the parameters of common fitting functions for density, pressure, and entropy. Conclusions. Recent accretion leaves measurable imprints on the ICM structure, highlighting the potential of thermodynamic profiles as diagnostics of cluster growth history.
#### Unsupervised Kinematic Dissection of the Solar Neighborhood: Identifying Stellar Moving Groups with Gaia DR3

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive kinematic analysis of the solar neighborhood (d < 50 pc) using high-precision astrometric data from the third Gaia Data Release (DR3). By leveraging the full six dimensional phase space information (positions and velocities), we apply the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm to blindly identify stellar overdensities in the Galactocentric Cartesian velocity space (U, V, W ). Our unsupervised machine learning approach successfully recovers the kinematic cores of major local moving groups, including the Hyades and Pleiades streams, without prior assumptions regarding their membership or spatial distribution. We analyze the velocity dispersion and structural properties of these associations, demonstrating that automated clustering algorithms are robust tools for mapping the complex dynamical history of the local Milky Way disk. These results confirm the hierarchical nature of stellar kinematic substructures and provide a catalog of high-probability members for future spectroscopic follow-up.

 - **Abstract**
 Deep radio continuum surveys provide fundamental constraints on galaxy evolution, but source confusion limits sensitivity to the faintest sources. We present a complete framework for producing high-fidelity deblended radio catalogs from the confused MIGHTEE maps using the probabilistic deblending framework XID+ and prior positions from deep multi-wavelength data in the COSMOS field. To assess performance, we construct MIGHTEE-like simulations based on the Tiered Radio Extragalactic Continuum Simulation (T-RECS) radio source population, ensuring a realistic distribution of star-forming galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGN) for validation. Through these simulations, we show that prior catalog purity is the dominant factor controlling deblending accuracy: a high-purity prior, containing only sources with a high likelihood of radio detection, recovers accurate flux densities and reproduces input source counts down to $\sim 3\sigma$ (where $\sigma = $ thermal noise). On the other hand, a complete prior overestimates the source counts due to spurious detections. Our optimal strategy combines the high-purity prior with a mask that removes sources detected above $50~\mu$Jy. Applied to the $\sim$1.3\,deg$^2$ area of the MIGHTEE-COSMOS field defined by overlapping multi-wavelength data, this procedure yields a deblended catalog of 89,562 sources. The derived 1.4\,GHz source counts agree with independent P(D) analyses and indicate that we resolve the radio background to $\sim 4.8\,\mu$Jy. We also define a recommended high-fidelity sample of 20,757 sources, based on detection significance, flux density, and goodness-of-fit, which provides reliable flux densities for individual sources in the confusion-limited regime.
#### The stellar and dark matter distributions in elliptical galaxies measured by stacked weak gravitational lensing

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09342

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate stellar mass and central dark matter density profiles of photometric luminous red galaxies with stellar masses of $\sim10^{10}-10^{12}M_\odot$ using weak gravitational lensing measurements from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program data obtained with the Subaru Telescope. By stacking weak lensing signals from a large number of galaxies, we obtain average tangential shear profiles down to $\sim 10\,\mathrm{kpc}/h$, which are fitted assuming a two-component model consisting of stellar and dark matter components to constrain their central dark matter distribution. We find a preference for non-zero core radii of dark matter distributions in galaxies with stellar masses of $\sim 10^{11}M_\odot$. Our results imply a stronger feedback effect than that typically predicted by current hydrodynamical simulations. In addition, we provide a new constraint on the stellar-to-halo mass relation, where both stellar and halo masses are, for the first time, directly constrained by weak gravitational lensing. Our results prefer the stellar initial mass function (IMF) that is more bottom-heavy than the Salpeter IMF.
#### Bimetric MOND as a framework for variable-$G$ theories -- local systems and cosmology

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09353

 - **Abstract**
 Bimetric MOND (BIMOND) is used as a platform for variable-$G$ theories that have MOND-specific idiosyncrasies. E.g., MOND premises dictate return to standard dynamics in the high-acceleration limit, predicting the standard value of $G$ for high-acceleration systems. This automatically ensures compliance of such theories with all the constraints on inconstancy of $G$ that emerge from the study of high-acceleration systems: geophysics, solar system, pulsars, supernovae, stellar evolution, emission of gravitational waves, etc. In MOND, constraints deduced from such phenomena have no bearing on possible $G$ variability in cosmology. My guiding motivation is to see if such theories may account for some roles of dark matter in cosmology; e.g., in accounting for the expansion history of the Universe in the matter-dominated era, by having a $G_e\approx 2\pi G$ govern the later stages of the expansion, instead of invoking matter density $\approx 2\pi\times$ baryon density. Without adding degrees of freedom, or new dimensionful constants, BIMOND can be extended to a class of theories that entail what is best described as phenomenon-dependence of Newton's constant, $G$. I cannot yet present a consistent model that complies with all the observations in cosmology, including the expansion history, with all its details. Instead, I describe some examples of theories in the class that predict different values of $G_e$ in different circumstances, including one where $G$ takes its standard value for all subcosmological systems -- even if they are deep in the MOND regime. I also discuss scenarios in which $G_e\approx G$ in the early Universe, as required by constraints from big-bang nucleosynthesis, but with $G_e> G$ setting in at later times, where it can affect the expansion history during the matter-dominated era.

 - **Abstract**
 Extracting parameters from the global 21cm signal is crucial for understanding the early Universe. However, detecting the 21cm signal is challenging due to the brighter foreground and associated observational difficulties. In this study, we evaluate the performance of various machine-learning regression models to improve parameter extraction and foreground removal. This evaluation is essential for selecting the most suitable machine learning regression model based on computational efficiency and predictive accuracy. We compare four models: Random Forest Regressor (RFR), Gaussian Process Regressor (GPR), Support Vector Regressor (SVR), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The comparison is based on metrics such as the root mean square error (RMSE) and $R^2$ scores. We examine their effectiveness across different dataset sizes and conditions, including scenarios with foreground contamination. Our results indicate that ANN consistently outperforms the other models, achieving the lowest RMSE and the highest $R^2$ scores across multiple cases. While GPR also performs well, it is computationally intensive, requiring significant RAM and longer execution times. SVR struggles with large datasets due to its high computational costs, and RFR demonstrates the weakest accuracy among the models tested. We also found that employing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as a preprocessing step significantly enhances model performance, especially in the presence of foregrounds.

 - **Abstract**
 The fundamental character of a fermionic dark matter, whether it is a Dirac or Majorana particle remains a key unresolved issue whose answer would profoundly affect dark-sector phenomenology and detection strategies thereby motivates complementary probes across particle and astrophysical experiments. Compact stars, particularly neutron stars, offer unique astrophysical laboratories for probing such fundamental properties under extreme densities. The presence of a fermionic DM admixed with nuclear matter can modify the equation of state, thereby affecting observable quantities such as the mass-radius (M-R) relation and tidal deformability. In this work, we investigate how the intrinsic particle nature of fermionic DM influences neutron star structure. Within a relativistic mean-field framework extended by a scalar (or Higgs like) portal coupling between DM and nucleons, we construct self-consistent equation of states for both Dirac and Majorana cases and solve the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations to obtain stellar configurations. Owing to the difference in internal degrees of freedom, Dirac DM (four degrees of freedom) generally softens the equation of state more strongly than Majorana DM (two degrees of freedom), leading to smaller radii and lower maximum masses. We identify the parameter space consistent with current NICER and gravitational-wave constraints, highlighting the potential of compact-star observations to discriminate between Dirac and Majorana dark matter.
#### SLICE -- Combining Strong Lensing and X-ray in AC\,114. Insights into the Merger Scenario

 - **Abstract**
 AC114 is a historically significant galaxy cluster, being one of the first strong lensing clusters detected from the ground in the early 1990s, prior to the launch of the HST. Despite this early prominence, no detailed lensing analyses have been carried out for more than fifteen years. We here study this cluster using JWST imaging obtained as part of the SLICE program, complemented by archival HST and X-ray observations. JWST data reveal ten new multiply imaged systems and enable the identification of conjugate substructures in several of the sixteen systems, significantly increasing the number of strong lensing constraints. Using these data, we construct a parametric mass model with Lenstool and extend it by explicitly incorporating the Chandra data in a combined strong lensing+X-ray fit. Our best-fit model reproduces the multiple images with an RMS of 0.4" while simultaneously matching the X-ray data. The dark matter distribution is unimodal and centered on the brightest cluster galaxy, with a large core radius of 83+-5kpc, consistent with values reported in other strong lensing clusters. The strong lensing constraints require the inclusion of an external shear component which position angle points unambiguously towards a nearby (~1Mpc), well defined mass concentration at the same redshift in the North-West, for which we propose the naming AC114b. The spatial coverage of the XMM-Newton data encompasses the whole structure, allowing us to probe the X-ray properties of the companion cluster and the thermodynamics of AC114, providing evidence for a major merger, in line with previous signatures seen in Chandra, radio and optical spectroscopic data. Our results shed new light on the merging scenario, revealing a major merger caught in a late post-collisional phase, where AC114 is the dominant system and Ac114b has likely been stripped of its hot gas.

 - **Abstract**
 The Euclid mission has been designed to provide, as one of its main deliverables, information on the nature of the gravitational interaction, which determines the expansion of the Universe and the formation of structures. Thus, Euclid has the potential to test deviations from general relativity that will allow us to shed light on long-lasting problems in the standard cosmological model, $\Lambda$CDM. Euclid will mainly do this by using two complementary probes: weak gravitational lensing and galaxy clustering. In this paper we review pre-launch Euclid analyses for dark energy and modified gravity. These include forecast constraints with future Euclid data on cosmological parameters for different cosmological models, such as a time-varying dark energy component, phenomenological modifications of the perturbation sector and specific modified gravity models, with further extensions that include neutrino physics and the coupling to the electromagnetic sector through the fine-structure constant. We review the study of the impact of nonlinear clustering methods on beyond-$\Lambda$CDM constraints with Euclid. This is of fundamental importance to efficiently predict the large-scale clustering of matter and dark matter halos, given that we will have access to a wealth of information on scales beyond the linear regime. We inspect the extension of theoretical predictions for observable quantities in alternative cosmologies to $\Lambda$CDM at fully nonlinear scales by means of $N$-body simulations. We discuss the impact of relativistic corrections in extended cosmological models. Overall, this review highlights the significant potential of the Euclid mission to tightly constrain parameters of dark energy and modified gravity models, or perhaps to detect possible signatures of a $\Lambda$CDM failure.
#### Self-consistent secondary cosmic microwave background anisotropies and extragalactic foregrounds in the FLAMINGO simulations

 - **Abstract**
 Secondary anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) contain information that can be used to test both cosmological models and models of galaxy formation. Starting from lightcone-based HEALPix maps and catalogues, we present a new set of mock CMB maps constructed in a self-consistent manner from the FLAMINGO suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, including CMB lensing, thermal and kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effects, cosmic infrared background, radio point source and anisotropic screening maps. We show that these simulations reproduce a wide range of observational constraints. We also compare our simulations with previous predictions based on dark matter-only simulations which generally model the secondary anisotropies independently from one another, concluding that our hydrodynamical simulation mocks perform at least as well as previous mocks in matching the observations whilst retaining self-consistency in the predictions of the different components. Using the model variations in FLAMINGO, we further explore how the signals depend on cosmology and feedback modelling, and we predict cross-correlations between some of the signals that differ significantly from those in previous mocks. The mock CMB maps should provide a valuable resource for exploring correlations between different secondary anisotropies and other large-scale structure tracers, and can be applied to forecasts for upcoming surveys.
