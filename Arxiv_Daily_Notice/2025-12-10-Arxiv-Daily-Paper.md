 - **Abstract**
 The nature of dark matter (DM) is still debated. While cold DM (CDM) is the standard paradigm, warm DM (WDM) may ease some small-scale tensions in the $\Lambda$CDM framework. Line-intensity mapping (LIM) offers a novel probe of DM properties. To explore the potential of LIM surveys in constraining the WDM particle mass ($m_\mathrm{WDM}$) by means of the [C II] power spectrum (PS), we provide forecasts for the Deep Spectroscopic Survey (DSS) at $z\simeq3.6$ and extend the analysis to larger sky coverage, higher sensitivity, and/or increased spectral resolution. We develop a formulation for the [C II] PS based on the halo-model approach, incorporating the uncertainty in the luminosity function (LF) through two alternative parameterisations. We perform a Bayesian analysis on mock data to derive constraints on $m_\mathrm{WDM}$. In a CDM universe, the DSS yields lower limits on $m_\mathrm{WDM}$ at $95\%$ credibility level (CL) of $1.10$ keV and $0.58$ keV when considering the optimistic and pessimistic LF ($\alpha = -1.1$), respectively. Ambitious surveys can improve these figures to $5.82$ keV and $1.90$ keV, and assuming a steeper faint-end slope ($\alpha = -1.9$) further boosts these limits. A fivefold increase in spectral resolution enhances sensitivity to the damping scale associated to redshift-space distortions, tightening the constraints on $m_\mathrm{WDM}$ by a factor of up to $\sim1.8$. Finally, Bayesian inference on mock data with $m_\mathrm{WDM}=3$ keV results in a well-constrained and unbiased posterior only in futuristic survey setups. Upcoming LIM surveys can provide meaningful limits on $m_\mathrm{WDM}$, although the negligible contribution from small haloes reduces the constraining power of the [C II] PS. Future progress will benefit from combining multiple redshifts and emission lines, opening the way to competitive constraints on the nature of DM.
#### Danger Zone: Establishing Buffers for Enhanced Classification in BPT Diagrams

 - **Abstract**
 This study utilizes unsupervised machine learning, specifically the uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) algorithm, to classify optical spectra originating from star-forming regions, Seyferts, and low-ionization (nuclear) emission-line regions (LI(N)ERs) based on their line ratios. Typically, the ionization source of a region is determined from intensity ratio of different combinations of pairs of spectral lines. However, using current boundary definitions, $\sim10$\% of spectra change classes between diagnostic diagrams. We apply the machine learning technique to $\sim$1.3 million optical spectra from 6,439 galaxies observed in the MaNGA survey. By training UMAP on consistently classified data, we can classify these ``ambiguous'' spectra, and delineate boundary zones where such ambiguities arise. Furthermore, we identify physically interesting subsets within the ambiguous spectra. Future work will incorporate additional parameters, such as alternative emission line ratios and velocity dispersions, to enhance classification accuracy.
#### Spatially Resolved Physical Properties of Young Star Clusters and Star-forming Clumps in the Brightest z>6 Galaxy, the Strongly Lensed Cosmic Spear at z=6.2

 - **Abstract**
 We present spatially resolved analysis of stellar populations in the brightest $z>6$ galaxy known to date (AB mag 23), the strongly lensed MACS0308$-$zD1 (dubbed the ``Cosmic Spear'') at $z_{\rm spec}=6.2$. New JWST NIRCam imaging and high-resolution NIRSpec IFU spectroscopy span the rest-frame ultraviolet to optical. The NIRCam imaging reveals bright star-forming clumps and a tail consisting of three distinct, extremely compact star clusters that are multiply-imaged by gravitational lensing. The star clusters have effective radii of $R_{\rm{eff}} \sim 5$ pc, stellar masses of $M_{*} \sim 10^{6}-10^{7}\,M_{\odot}$, and high stellar mass surface densities of $\Sigma_{*} > 10^{4}\,M_{\odot}~\rm{pc}^{-2}$. While their stellar populations are very young ($\sim 5-9$ Myr), their dynamical ages exceed unity, consistent with the clusters being gravitationally bound systems. Placing the star clusters in the size vs.~stellar mass density plane, we find they occupy a region similar to other high-redshift star clusters within galaxies observed recently with JWST, being significantly more massive and denser than local star clusters. Spatially resolved analysis of the brightest clump reveals a compact, intensely star-forming core. The ionizing photon production efficiency ($\xi_{\rm{ion}}$) is slightly suppressed in this central region, potentially indicating a locally elevated Lyman continuum escape fraction facilitated by feedback-driven channels.
#### The Two-Infall Model Revisited: Constraints on Milky Way Bulge Assembly from >30,000 Galactic Chemical Evolution Models and Machine Learning

 - **Abstract**
 We constrain the formation history of the Milky Way bulge using a two-infall Galactic Chemical Evolution (GCE) framework implemented in the OMEGA++ code. We recover a best-fit scenario in which the bulge forms through an early, rapid starburst (t1 ~ 0.1Gyr, tau1 ~ 0.09Gyr, star-formation efficiency (SFE) ~ 3Gyr^-1 followed by a delayed, lower mass second infall (t2 ~ 5.1Gyr, tau2 ~ 1.7Gyr, sigma2 ~ 0.69). Our model adopts mass- and metallicity-dependent nucleosynthetic yields from modern stellar grids and explores a wide GCE parameter space in infall timing, star formation efficiency, mass partitioning, IMF upper mass, and SN Ia normalization, optimized via a hybrid genetic algorithm with MCMC refinement. The later infall features a reduced star formation efficiency (Delta SFE ~ 0.72), reproducing the metal-rich peak of the bulge metallicity distribution function (MDF) and the decline in [alpha/Fe] at high [Fe/H]. Our model naturally favors the Joyce et al. (2023) age--metallicity relation over the ages in Bensby et al. (2017). Degeneracy and principal component analysis show that the infall history, SFE, and mass partitioning are strongly covariant -- the bulge's observed MDF, abundance trends, and age distribution constrain only their combinations, not each parameter independently. The results support a composite bulge origin -- a classical collapse builds the majority of the mass, while a younger component is required to match the late stage enrichment.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational waves (GWs) are powerful probes of new physics in the early Universe. In particular, GWs induced by primordial isocurvature perturbations encode information of novel dynamics beyond the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Existing studies of isocurvature induced GWs focus on a particular type: cold dark matter (CDM) isocurvature. In this work, we present a more comprehensive study of four kinds of isocurvature involving CDM, baryons, neutrinos and free-streaming dark radiation (DR). We first reformulate initial conditions of isocurvature with coupled neutrinos because modes relevant for observations at Pulsar Timing Arrays enter the horizon before neutrino decoupling. With these new initial conditions, neutrino isocurvature is phenomenologically similar to CDM isocurvature up to an overall coefficient, which leads to an interesting conversion of isocurvature between radiation and matter sectors. We then find that the spectrum of isocurvature induced GWs from free-streaming DR is qualitatively different than that from CDM due to the presence of anisotropic stress. Unlike GWs induced by CDM isocurvature that are suppressed at high frequencies due to matter density being suppressed at early times, DR isocurvature induced GWs is proportional to the constant ratio between DR density and total radiation. Finally, we utilize two general parametrizations of the isocurvature power spectrum: a delta function and a broken power law, and derive novel constraints with recent NANOGrav data. Our results set stringent constraints on isocurvature around $10^{6}\,\textrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, which are complementary to cosmological observations at large scales.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultracool dwarfs consist of lowest-mass stars and brown dwarfs. Their interior is fully convective, different from that of the partly-convective Sun-like stars. Magnetic field generation process beneath the surface of ultracool dwarfs is still poorly understood and controversial. To increase samples of active ultracool dwarfs significantly, we have identified 962 ultracool dwarfs in the latest LAMOST data release, DR11. We also simulate the Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST) low-resolution slitless spectra by degrading the LAMOST spectra. A semi-supervised machine learning approach with an autoencoder model is built to identify ultracool dwarfs with the simulated CSST spectra, which demonstrates the capability of the CSST all-sky slitless spectroscopic survey on the detection of ultracool dwarfs. Magnetic activity of the ultracool dwarfs is investigated by using the H$\alpha$ line emission as a proxy. The rotational periods of 82 ultracool dwarfs are derived based on the Kepler/K2 light curves. We also derive the activity-rotation relation of the ultracool dwarfs, which is saturated around a Rossby number of 0.12.

 - **Abstract**
 Machine learning techniques using proper elements to reconnect families of satellite fragmentation debris have recently advanced, becoming key to space sustainability and domain awareness. However, an evolving circumterrestrial environment may limit their applicability, particularly when models are trained on outdated debris representations. In this work, we devise a computational pipeline using synthetic fragmentation data from explosive breakup events, generated via a Standard Breakup Model and propagated under a high-fidelity dynamical model. Proper elements are extracted using adapted algorithms for modified equinoctial (MEE), Poincar'e (PNC), and quaternion (QTN) sets. Extending beyond previous approaches limited to MEE space, we include PNC and QTN sets to broaden the dynamical fingerprints available to the classifier. Neural networks trained on various element combinations are used to determine if fragment pairs share a parent. Crucially, we identify a fundamental limitation when applying standard quaternion sets to neural networks: the loss of orbital size information during feature normalization. We introduce an augmented representation (QTN$_p$) that explicitly restores the semi-latus rectum, improving accuracy from 0.31 to 0.60 compared to the standard set. In synthetic Starlink-like LEO experiments, expanding proper-element sets generally improves discrimination. The best model, using a joint feature set (MEE + PNC + QTN), achieves an ROC-AUC of 0.858 compared to 0.789 for the MEE-only baseline, alongside higher accuracy and F1 scores.

 - **Abstract**
 The properties of dwarf galaxies provide essential insight into galaxy formation and evolution in a hierarchical universe. Among various physical quantities, identifying their infall times to host galaxies is crucial, as these times encode key information such as star formation histories. However, estimating infall times remains challenging due to the complex interplay between different physical processes and the lack of consensus among existing methods. We propose a fast and interpretable method to predict the infall time of dwarf satellites using LightGBM, a gradient-boosting decision tree algorithm. Our model is trained on satellites from 30 Milky Way (MW)-like host galaxies generated by A-SLOTH, a semi-analytic model calibrated using observational constraints, including those from the MW and its satellites. To balance predictive ability and observational applicability, we adopt $\tau_{90}$, [Fe/H], and $M_{\star}$ as input features. Since satellites with prior group membership hinder accurate MW infall predictions, we exclude them from the training data. As a result, the model achieves the best average mean squared error (MSE) of 5.04 in the A-SLOTH data set. Our model also shows good agreement with existing observational studies of MW satellites, although some discrepancies remain due to a few outliers such as CVn II and UMa I. In addition, for satellites experiencing prior infall events before MW-like host infall, the model predicts the timing of the first infall with a significantly lower MSE of 1.66, indicating the importance of the earliest infall in the quenching process of satellite galaxies.
#### Foreground Mitigation for CMB Lensing with the Global Minimum Variance Quadratic Estimator

 - **Abstract**
 Weak gravitational lensing of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) is a powerful probe of cosmology, providing insight into structure formation and the evolution of the universe. Current and upcoming CMB experiments such as SPT-3G and the Simons Observatory (SO) provide high-resolution, low-noise temperature and polarization maps that are ideal for lensing reconstruction. The global minimum variance (GMV) quadratic estimator for CMB lensing reduces reconstruction noise over the standard quadratic estimator (SQE). In this work, we extend the GMV framework to incorporate the tSZ-deproj and cross-ILC foreground mitigation techniques, which enhance robustness against contamination from astrophysical sources. For SPT-3G Ext-10k and SO Extended at $\ell_{\mathrm{max}}^T = 3500$, the lensing bias at $L < 1000$ is reduced from $\sim4\%$ with standard GMV and SQE to $2\%$ with tSZ-deproj, and to $< 1\%$ with cross-ILC. These methods enable the construction of foreground-cleaned lensing maps suitable for cross-correlation analyses, with direct relevance for current and future surveys.
