 - **Abstract**
 Based on deep high resolution JWST images of AS1063, and after a careful masking of artifacts, extended features in the cluster, and background galaxies (including known lensed ones), we have identified tens of thousands of unresolved point sources in the central region of the galaxy cluster. We extended the identification of these point sources up to 1.18 Mpc from the center of the cluster using data in the second module. Most of these sources are expected to be globular clusters orbiting in the deep potential well of the cluster, but also the surviving compact cores of satellite galaxies. We study the distribution of the globular clusters and compared it with the distribution of mass from a lens model derived from the same JWST data. We find a very tight correlation between the two distributions, but also some differences, including a more concentrated distribution for the globular clusters than for dark matter. We explored the possibility of using the distribution of globular clusters as a proxy for the lensing mass. We find that a simple smoothing kernel can transform the discrete distribution of point sources into a continuous two-dimensional distribution that matches well the lensing convergence. This suggests that globular clusters can be used as tracers of the dark matter distribution in other massive clusters where gravitational lensing constraints are scarce but globular clusters can be detected more easily, for instance in low redshift galaxy clusters.
#### Full-Spectrum Machine Learning Diagnostics for Interstellar PAHs

 - **Abstract**
 Traditional interstellar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) diagnostics rely on empirical band ratios, which often suffer from information loss and sample-selection bias. We introduce a machine learning framework that bypasses these limitations by treating the complete 2.75-20 micron emission spectrum as a high-dimensional fingerprint. Using a Random Forest classifier trained on a dataset of 23,653 spectra, we achieve a robust classification F1-score of about 0.96 across 12 size and charge categories. Our model maintains high performance on synthetic mixtures of unseen molecules. Feature importance analysis reveals that PAH size diagnostics are not universal but highly charge-dependent; while neutral size is traced mainly by C-H stretching modes, sizing ionized species also relies on the morphology of 6-8 micron C-C complexes, with the 12.5 micron feature emerging as a robust cross-charge tracer. This approach provides a robust, data-driven pathway for decoding the physical conditions of the interstellar medium.
#### Graph Neural Network Prediction of Infrared Spectra of Interstellar Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons

 - **Abstract**
 Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are recognized as the primary contributors to the aromatic infrared bands (AIBs) widely observed in space. However, analyzing these AIBs remains challenging because of the immense structural diversity within the PAH family, which makes the computation of reliable reference spectra difficult. To address this, we developed an efficient graph neural network (GNN) framework that can predict PAH absorption spectra up to 10,000 times faster than traditional quantum chemical methods. We evaluated four representative GNN architectures, including graph convolutional network (GCN), graph attention network (GAT), message passing neural network (MPNN), and attentive fingerprint (AFP). The AFP model is found to deliver the best overall performance and is further trained using five different spectral distance metrics as loss functions, among which the Jensen-Shannon divergence yields the most accurate and stable results. The model performs best for PAHs containing 20-40 carbon atoms, while accuracy decreases for larger molecules, reflecting the limited availability of training data. Overall, this framework offers a fast method to generate approximate reference spectra for small- to medium-sized PAHs, supporting future AIB analysis.

 - **Abstract**
 In this whitepaper, we outline how recent technological advances and ongoing developments open qualitatively new science opportunities in cosmology, fundamental physics, and quantum astrophysics. First, intensity interferometry can contribute to one of the most foundational observables in cosmology: the expansion rate of the Universe. Its angular resolution allows it to resolve the angular extent of extragalactic objects such as supernovae or quasars; combined with a physical scale local to the source, this yields an angular diameter distance and hence a 'Hubble diagram'. Second, the nature of dark matter can be probed via the astrometric lensing signatures of tiny dark matter halos. Third, intensity interferometry gives direct access to second-order coherence properties of astrophysical emission, opening a window onto genuinely quantum aspects of astrophysical light.
