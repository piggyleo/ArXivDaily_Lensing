#### Where Giants Dwell: Probing the Environments of Early Massive Quiescent Galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the environments of massive quiescent galaxies at 3 < z < 5 using the GAlaxy Evolution and Assembly (GAEA) theoretical model. We select galaxies with stellar mass ~10^10.8 Msun and specific star formation rate below 0.3x t_Hubble, yielding in a sample of about 5,000 galaxies within a simulated volume of ~685 Mpc. These galaxies have formation times that cover well the range inferred from recent observational data, including a few rare objects with very short formation time-scales and early formation epochs. Model high-z quiescent galaxies are alpha-enhanced and exhibit a wide range of stellar metallicity, in broad agreement with current observational estimates. Massive high-z quiescent galaxies in our model occupy a wide range of environments, from void-like regions to dense knots at the intersections of filaments. Quiescent galaxies in underdense regions typically reside in halos that collapsed early and grew rapidly at high redshift, though this trend becomes difficult to identify observationally due to large intrinsic scatter in star formation histories. The descendants of high-z massive quiescent galaxies display a broad distribution in mass and environment by z=0, reflecting the stochastic nature of mergers. About one-third of these systems remain permanently quenched, while most rejuvenation events are merger-driven and more common in overdense regions. Our results highlight the diversity of early quiescent galaxies and caution against assuming that all such systems trace the progenitors of present day most massive clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 We derive the Tully-Fisher (TFR, $M_\ast-V_{\rm circ, f}$) and Fall (FR, $j_\ast-M_\ast$) relations at redshift $z = 0.9$ using a sample of 43 main-sequence disc galaxies with H$\alpha$ IFU data and JWST/HST imaging. The strength of our analysis lies in the use of state-of-the-art 3D kinematic models to infer galaxy rotation curves, the inclusion and morphological modelling of NIR bands, and the use of SED modelling applied to our photometry measurements to estimate stellar masses. After correcting the inferred H$\alpha$ velocities for asymmetric drift, we find a TFR of the form $\log(M_\ast / M_\odot) = a \log(V_{\rm circ,f} / 150~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}) + b$, with $a=3.82^{+0.55}_{-0.40}$ and $b=10.27^{+0.06}_{-0.07}$, as well as a FR of the form $\log(j_\ast / \mathrm{kpc\,km\,s^{-1}}) = a \log(M_\ast / 10^{10.5} M_\odot) + b$, with $a=0.44^{+0.06}_{-0.06}$ and $b=2.86^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$. When compared to their $z=0$ counterparts, we find moderate evolution in the TFR and strong evolution in the FR over the past $8$ Gyr. We interpret our findings in the context of the galaxy-to-halo scaling parameters $f_{\rm M}=M_\ast/M_{\rm vir}$ and $f_{\rm j}=j_\ast/j_{\rm vir}$. We infer that at $z=0.9$ both $f_{\rm M}$ and $f_{\rm j}$ are higher and less mass-dependent than at $z=0$. We speculate that the evolution of $f_{\rm j}$ can be driven by more efficient and centrally concentrated stellar feedback at $z=0.9$, or by an appreciable dry merger history. We also show that assuming the galaxies populating our $z=0.9$ relations evolve into those populating the $z=0$ relations leads to an apparent discrepancy with the hierarchical growth of dark matter halos. To solve this issue, one needs to evoke a progenitor bias scenario, unknown systematics affecting our and previous measurements, or consider the possibility that H$\alpha$ kinematics is not a reliable dynamical tracer.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. As the number of detected transiting exoplanet candidates continues to grow, the need for robust and scalable automated tools to prioritize or validate them has become increasingly critical. Among the most promising solutions, deep learning models offer the ability to interpret complex diagnostic metrics traditionally used in the vetting process. Aims. In this work, we present WATSON-Net, a new open-source neural network classifier and data preparation package designed to compete with current state-of-the-art tools for vetting and validation of transiting exoplanet signals from space-based missions. Methods. Trained on Kepler Q1-Q17 DR25 data using 10-fold cross-validation, WATSON-Net produces ten independent models, each evaluated on dedicated validation and test sets. The ten models are calibrated and prepared to be extensible for TESS data by standardizing the input pipeline, allowing for performance assessment across different space missions. Results. For Kepler targets, WATSON-Net achieves a recall-at-precision of 0.99 (R@P0.99) of 0.903, ranking second, with only the ExoMiner network performing better (R@P0.99 = 0.936). For TESS signals, WATSON-Net emerges as the best-performing non-fine-tuned machine learning classifier, achieving a precision of 0.93 and a recall of 0.76 on a test set comprising confirmed planets and false positives. Both the model and its data preparation tools are publicly available in the dearwatson Python package, fully open-source and integrated into the vetting engine of the SHERLOCK pipeline.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational wave sources with electromagnetic counterparts have highlighted the need for predictive, interpretable models linking the parameters of compact binary systems to post-merger remnants and mass outflows. In this work, we explore AI-driven symbolic regression (SR) frameworks to derive updated analytical relations for disk ejecta mass in binary neutron star mergers, trained on state-of-the-art numerical relativity simulations. Our method reveals a set of compact equations that outperform existing fitting formulae across multiple statistical metrics while remaining physically interpretable. Notably, SR also enables alternative predictor sets (e.g., $\{M_1,M_2,\tilde{\Lambda}\}$) that match or exceed the accuracy of models relying solely on compactness of the lightest neutron star ($C_1$), enabling new parameter constraints from electromagnetic observations. Unlike traditional black-box machine learning models, these closed-form expressions generalize robustly to regions of the parameter space not represented in the training data, offering a physics-informed tool for multimessenger observations and constraints on the neutron star equation of state.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmological perturbation theory provides the fundamental framework for describing the evolution of the matter-energy density field in an expanding Universe and serves as the basis for understanding the formation of large-scale structures within the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. We present an analytical approach to describe the evolution of fluctuations in a mixed fluid composed of cold dark matter (CDM) and baryonic matter. Assuming that the Universe is governed by General Relativity, we employ the Vlasov equation to derive the general equations of motion for this mixed cosmological fluid, incorporating baryonic effects through the stress tensor by considering only the contributions from baryonic pressure. We introduce the Jeans filtering functions as a biasing tool that allows us to describe baryonic fluctuations with CDM as a tracer, and we obtain an analytical description of the fluctuations -a novel and uncommon approach compared to the accepted computational advances currently available in this field. First- and second-order solutions are obtained through a single iteration of the equations of motion, with the aim of identifying how the filtering scale behaves in a second-order theory compared to the linear one, as well as some of its impacts on the matter power spectrum without the need to compute it explicitly. For the first time, these kind of solutions are derived entirely through an analytical method. Finally, we obtain analytical expressions for baryonic fluctuations in the density and velocity fields, which can be readily evaluated and provide valuable insights into the role of baryons in the Large-scale structure of the Universe. Consequently, these results reveal how pressure effects shift the filtering scale and how including this component could influence parameters such as the filtering mass and the temperature of the pressure-supported components.

 - **Abstract**
 J-PAS (Javalambre Physics of the Accelerating Universe Astrophysical Survey) will present a groundbreaking photometric survey covering 8500 deg$^2$ of the visible sky from Javalambre, capturing data in 56 narrow band filters. This survey promises to revolutionize galaxy evolution studies by observing $\sim$10$^8$ galaxies with low spectral resolution. A crucial aspect of this analysis involves predicting stellar population parameters from the observed galaxy photometry. In this study, we combine the exquisite J-PAS photometry with state-of-the-art single stellar population (SSP) libraries to accurately predict stellar age, metallicity, and dust attenuation with a neural network (NN) model. The NN is trained on synthetic J-PAS photometry from different SSP librares (E-MILES, Charlot & Bruzual, XSL), to enhance the robustness of our predictions against individual SSP model variations and limitations. To create mock samples with varying observed magnitudes we add artificial noise in the form of random Gaussian variations within typical observational uncertainties in each band. Our results indicate that the NN can accurately estimate stellar parameters for SSP models without evident degeneracies, surpassing a bayesian SED-fitting method on the same test set. We obtain median bias, scatter and percentage of outliers $\mu$ = (0.01 dex, 0.00 dex, 0.00 mag), $\sigma_{NMAD}$ = (0.23 dex, 0.29 dex, 0.04 mag), f$_{o}$ = (17 %, 24 %, 1 %) at $ i \sim$17 mag for age, metallicity and dust attenuation, respectively. The accuracy of the predictions is highly dependent on the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of the photometry, achieving robust predictions up to $i$ $\sim$ 20 mag.

 - **Abstract**
 Lensed gravitational waves (GWs) provide a new window into the study of dark matter substructures, yet the faint interference signatures they produce are buried in detector noise. To address this challenge, we develop a deep learning framework based on a residual one-dimensional convolutional neural network for lensed GW identification under multiband observations. The model directly processes multiband waveforms from binary neutron star systems, covering the early inspiral observed by the DECi-hertz Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory (DECIGO) and the late inspiral observed by the Einstein Telescope (ET), corresponding approximately to the wave-optics and geometrical-optics regimes, respectively. It enables end-to-end classification of five classes: pure noise, unlensed GWs, and three representative lensed GWs corresponding to singular isothermal sphere (SIS), cored isothermal sphere (CIS), and Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profiles. A dataset of 10^6 simulated samples was constructed with signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) ranging from 5 to 100. The deep learning model with multiband observations achieves an accuracy of 97.0% and a macro-averaged F1 score of 0.97, significantly exceeding the single-detector performance, where DECIGO and ET reach 72.8% and 62.3%, respectively. Even in the low-SNR regime (SNR < 20), the model maintains an accuracy above 63%, while in the high-SNR regime (SNR > 80), its accuracy approaches 99.8%. These results demonstrate that multiband GW observations effectively enhance the detection of lensed GWs within complex noise environments, providing a robust and efficient pathway for the automated identification of lensed GWs in future multiband observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Warped structures are often observed in disk galaxies, yet their physical origin is still under investigation. We present a systematic study of warped edge-on disk galaxies based on imaging data from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys DR8, with the expectation that this large sample size, enabled by wide-area surveys, will offer new perspectives on the formation of disk warps. Using a deep learning approach, we trained an EfficientNet-B3 convolutional neural network to classify the morphology of edge-on-disk galaxies into warped and non-warped categories. Our model was trained on a curated and visually verified set of labeled galaxy images and applied to a large dataset of over 595,651 edge-on disk galaxies selected from the Galaxy Zoo DESI catalog. Our results provide the largest warp catalog to date, consisting of 23996 warped edge-on disk galaxies, and reveal statistical trends between warp occurrence and galaxy properties. Compared to their non-warped counterparts, these warped disk galaxies tend to have bluer colors, lower stellar masses, higher gas fractions and star-formation rates, smaller Sérsic indices and larger disk sizes. In addition, warped disk galaxies show higher projected number densities of neighboring galaxies than their non-warped counterparts, particularly within \( R_{\mathrm{proj}} \lesssim 50~\mathrm{kpc} \), where the local number density is roughly twice as high.
