#### A Sample of Nearby Isolated Dwarf Galaxies: A First Look at the Mass Function of Field Dwarfs
 - **Authors:** Scott Carlsten, Jiaxuan Li, Jenny Greene, Alex Drlica-Wagner, Shany Danieli
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16766

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16766

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of the Exploration of Local VolumE Survey - Field (ELVES-Field), a survey of the dwarf galaxies in the Local Volume (LV; $D<10$ Mpc) over roughly $3,000$ square degrees, focusing on the field dwarf population. Candidates are detected using a semi-automated algorithm tailored for low surface brightness dwarfs. Using tests with injected galaxies, we show the detection is $50\%$ complete to $m_g\sim20$ mag and $M_\star \sim 10^6$ $M_\odot$. Candidates are confirmed to be true nearby dwarfs through distance measurements including redshift, tip of the red giant branch, and surface brightness fluctuations. We identify isolated, field dwarfs using various environmental criteria. Over the survey footprint, we detect and confirm 95 LV dwarfs, 44 of which we consider isolated. Using this sample, we infer the field dwarf mass function and find good agreement at the high-mass end with previous redshift surveys and with the predictions of the IllustrisTNG simulation. This sample of isolated, field dwarfs represents a powerful dataset to investigate aspects of small-scale structure and the effect of environment on dwarf galaxy evolution.
#### Testing the cosmic distance-duality relation with localized fast radio bursts: a cosmological model-independent study
 - **Authors:** Jéferson A. S. Fortunato, Surajit Kalita, Amanda Weltman

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16869

 - **Abstract**
 We test the Etherington cosmic distance-duality relation (CDDR), by comparing Type Ia supernova (SNIa) luminosity-distance information from the Pantheon+ compilation with an angular-diameter-distance reconstructed from localized Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). The core of our methodology is a data-driven reconstruction from FRBs using artificial neural networks (ANNs): we infer a smooth mean extragalactic dispersion-measure relation and use its redshift derivative to recover $H(z)$ and hence $D_\mathrm{A}^{\rm FRB}(z)$ without assuming a parametric form for the expansion history. Possible deviations from CDDR are parameterized through three one-parameter models of $\eta(z)\equiv D_\mathrm{L}/[(1+z)^2D_\mathrm{A}]$. We implement two complementary likelihoods: (i) a direct approach using individual SNIa with the full Pantheon+ covariance, and (ii) a machine-learning approach in which we reconstruct the SN Hubble diagram on the FRB redshift grid, propagating SN and FRB uncertainties into non-diagonal covariance matrices via Monte Carlo and bootstrap realizations. Within the FRB reconstruction, we anchor the mean extragalactic dispersion measure at $z=0$, which yields a data-driven constraint on the average host/near-source contribution $\mathrm{DM}_{\rm host}=128.8\pm 34.1\,\mathrm{pc\,cm^{-3}}$ ($3\sigma$ of statistical confidence). We find that both likelihood implementations give consistent posteriors and no statistically significant evidence for departures from CDDR at the current precision.
#### Theory of striped dynamic spectra of the Crab pulsar high-frequency interpulse
 - **Authors:** Mikhail V. Medvedev
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16955

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16955

 - **Abstract**
 A theory of the spectral "zebra" pattern of the Crab pulsar's high-frequency interpulse (HFIP) radio emission is developed. The observed emission bands are interference maxima caused by multiple ray propagation through the pulsar magnetosphere. The high-contrast interference pattern is the combined effect of gravitational lensing and plasma de-lensing of light rays. The model enables space-resolved tomography of the pulsar magnetosphere, yielding a radial plasma density profile of $n_{e}\propto r^{-3}$, which agrees with theoretical insights. We predict the zebra pattern trend to change at a higher frequency when the ray separation becomes smaller than the pulsar size. This frequency is predicted to be in the range between 42 GHz and 650 GHz, which is within the reach of existing facilities like ALMA and SMA. These observations hold significant importance and would contribute to our understanding of the magnetosphere. Furthermore, they offer the potential to investigate gravity in the strong field regime near the star's surface.
#### Varstrometry for Off-nucleus and Dual Subkiloparsec AGN (VODKA): Three Quadruply Lensed Quasars at Cosmic Noon in HST and JWST
 - **Authors:** Mingrui Liu, Yu-Ching Chen, Nadia L. Zakamska, Xin Liu, Yue Shen, Xuheng Ding, Arran Gross, Hsiang-Chih Hwang, Yuzo Ishikawa, Kedar A. Phadke

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16995

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16995

 - **Abstract**
 We present results from imaging observations of three quadruply lensed quasars by Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) at redshifts $z = 2.550$, 2.975, and 1.500. We model our targets assuming a singular isothermal ellipsoid mass profile and an elliptical SÃ\c{opyright}rsic profile for the lensing galaxies, and reconstruct the geometric configuration of each system with measured Einstein radii of 0.44$'$, 0.58$'$, and 0.49$'$. While no spectroscopic measurements are available for the lenses, we constrain the redshift of each lens to $0.5 < z < 1.2$, $1.0 < z < 1.5$, and $0.4 < z < 0.9$. For all three lenses, the best-fit light model yield a typical de Vaucouleurs $n_{\rm S\acute{e}rsic} \sim 4$ profile and an effective radius $R_e$ around $\sim 1.5 - 3.5$ kpc. We accordingly classify the three lenses as early-type galaxies at an intermediate to high redshift, a common type for strong lensing galaxies. Compared to other known quadruple lenses, the lensing galaxies in this work are at the lower end of the distribution of Einstein radii and upper end of the distribution of the lens redshifts. They represent an interesting quadrant of subarcsecond-separation lenses in the population of single-galaxy strong lensing which have been largely unexplored yet and will be great targets of interest in upcoming high-resolution lensing surveys.
#### Dynamical Modelling of Galactic Kinematics using Neural Networks

 - **Abstract**
 The advent of integral field data has revolutionised the study of galaxy evolution. A key component of this is dynamical modelling methods which have allowed for crucial insights to be made from kinematic data. Despite this importance, most dynamical models make a number of key assumptions which do not hold for real galaxies. These include assumptions about the geometry (axisymmetry or triaxiality), the shape of the velocity ellipsoid, and the shape of the underlying stellar distribution. At the same time, machine learning methods are becoming increasingly powerful, with many applications appearing in astronomy. As a first step towards building new dynamical modelling methods with machine learning, it is important to understand the types of machine learning architectures that are best fit for dynamical modelling. To investigate this, we construct a training set of dynamical models of early-type galaxies using Jeans Anisotropic Modelling (JAM). We then train a neural network on this data using the parameters of JAM and mock photometry as the input. We are able to accurately model JAM galaxies with relatively simple machine learning architectures, leading to a significant speed increase over traditional JAM modelling.
#### A Chemodynamical Census of the Milky Way's Ultra-Faint Compact Satellites. I. A First Population-Level Look at the Internal Kinematics and Metallicities of 19 Extremely-Low-Mass Halo Stellar Systems

 - **Abstract**
 Deep, wide-area photometric surveys have uncovered a population of compact ($r_{1/2} \approx$ 1-15 pc), extremely-low-mass ($M_* \approx$ 20-4000 $M_{\odot}$) stellar systems in the Milky Way halo that are smaller in size than known ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs) and substantially fainter than most classical globular clusters (GCs). Very little is known about the nature and origins of this population of "Ultra-Faint Compact Satellites" (UFCSs) owing to a dearth of spectroscopic measurements. Here, we present the first spectroscopic census of these compact systems based on Magellan/IMACS and Keck/DEIMOS observations of 19 individual UFCSs, representing $\sim$2/3 of the known population. We securely measure mean radial velocities for all 19 systems, velocity dispersions for 15 (predominantly upper limits), metallicities for 17, metallicity dispersions for 8, and $\textit{Gaia}$-based mean proper motions for 18. This large new spectroscopic sample provides the first insights into population-level trends for these extreme satellites. We demonstrate that: (1) the UFCSs are kinematically colder, on average, than the UFDs, disfavoring very dense dark matter halos in most cases, (2) the UFCS population is chemically diverse, spanning a factor of $\sim$300 in mean iron abundance ($\rm -3.3 \lesssim [Fe/H] \lesssim -0.8$), with multiple systems falling beneath the "metallicity floor" proposed for GCs, and (3) while some higher-metallicity and/or younger UFCSs are clearly star clusters, the dynamical and/or chemical evidence allows the possibility that up to $\sim$50% of the UFCSs in our sample (9 of 19) may represent the smallest and least-massive galaxies yet discovered.
