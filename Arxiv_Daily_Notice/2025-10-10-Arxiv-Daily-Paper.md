 - **Abstract**
 Major mergers of galaxies are likely to trigger bursty star formation activities. The accumulation of dense gas and the boost of star formation efficiency (SFE) are considered to be the two main drivers of the starbursts. However, it is still unclear how each process operates on the scale of individual star-forming clouds. Here, we present a high-resolution (2 Msun) RHD simulation of a gas-rich dwarf galaxy merger using the RIGEL model to investigate how mergers affect the properties of the structure of dense star-forming gas and the cloud-scale SFE. We track the evolution of sub-virial dense clouds in the simulation by mapping them across successive snapshots taken at intervals of 0.2 Myr. We found that the merger triggers a 130 times higher SFR and shortens the galaxy-wide gas-depletion time by two orders of magnitude compared to those of two isolated galaxies. However, the depletion time of individual clouds and their lifetime distribution remained unchanged over the simulation period. The cloud life cycles and cloud-scale SFE are determined by the local stellar feedback rather than environmental factors regardless of the merger process, and the integrated SFE ($\epsilon_{\rm int}$) of clouds in complex environments is still well described by an $\epsilon_{\rm int}-\Sigma_{\rm tot}$ relation found in idealized isolated-cloud experiments. During the peak of the starburst, the median integrated SFE only changed by 0.17-0.33 dex lower compared to the value when the galaxies are not interacting. The merger boosts the SFR primarily through the accumulation and compression of dense gas fueling star formation. Strong tidal torques assemble $>10^ 5$ Msun clouds that seed massive star clusters. The average separation between star-forming clouds decreases during the merger, which in turn decreases the cloud--cluster spatial decorrelation from >1 kpc to 0.1 kpc depicted by tuning fork diagrams.

 - **Abstract**
 Structure on sub-galactic scales provides important tests of galaxy formation models and the nature of dark matter. However, such objects are typically too faint to provide robust mass constraints. Here, we report the discovery of an extremely low-mass object detected via its gravitational perturbation to a thin lensed arc observed with milli-arcsecond-resolution very long baseline interferometry (VLBI). The object was identified using a non-parametric gravitational imaging technique and confirmed using independent parametric modelling. It contains a mass of $m_{\rm 80}=(1.13 \pm 0.04)\times 10^6{M_\odot}$ within a projected radius of 80 parsecs at an assumed redshift of 0.881. This detection is extremely robust and precise, with a statistical significance of 26$\sigma$, a 3.3 per cent fractional uncertainty on $m_{\rm 80}$, and an astrometric uncertainty of 194 $\mu$as. This is the lowest-mass object known to us, by two orders of magnitude, to be detected at a cosmological distance by its gravitational effect. This work demonstrates the observational feasibility of using gravitational imaging to probe the million-solar-mass regime far beyond our local Universe.
#### Robust Measurement of Stellar Streams Around the Milky Way: Correcting Spatially Variable Observational Selection Effects in Optical Imaging Surveys

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of density variations in stellar streams are a promising probe of low-mass dark matter substructure in the Milky Way. However, survey systematics such as variations in seeing and sky brightness can also induce artificial fluctuations in the observed densities of known stellar streams. These variations arise because survey conditions affect both object detection and star-galaxy misclassification rates. To mitigate these effects, we use Balrog synthetic source injections in the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Y3 data to calculate detection rate variations and classification rates as functions of survey properties. We show that these rates are nearly separable with respect to survey properties and can be estimated with sufficient statistics from the synthetic catalogs. Applying these corrections reduces the standard deviation of relative detection rates across the DES footprint by a factor of five, and our corrections significantly change the inferred linear density of the Phoenix stream when including faint objects. Additionally, for artificial streams with DES like survey properties we are able to recover density power spectra with reduced bias. We also find that uncorrected power-spectrum results for LSST-like data can be around five times more biased, highlighting the need for such corrections in future ground based surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 JWST's exquisite data have opened the doors to new possibilities in detecting broad classes of astronomical objects, but also to new challenges in classifying those objects. In this work, we introduce SESHAT, the Stellar Evolutionary Stage Heuristic Assessment Tool for the identification of Young Stellar Objects, field stars (main sequence through asymptotic giant branch), brown dwarfs, white dwarfs, and galaxies, from any JWST observation. This identification is done using the machine learning method XGBoost to analyze thousands of rows of synthetic photometry, modified at run-time to match the filters available in the data to be classified. We validate this tool on real data of both star-forming regions and cosmological fields, and find we are able to reproduce the observed classes of objects to a minimum of 80\% recall across every class, without additional information on the ellipticity or spatial distribution of the objects. Furthermore, this tool can be used to test the filter choices for JWST proposals, to verify whether the chosen filters are sufficient to identify the desired class of objects. SESHAT is released as a Python package to the community for general use.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational lensing is one of the most powerful probes of dark matter, yet creating high-fidelity lensed images at scale remains a bottleneck. Existing tools rely on ray-tracing or forward-modeling pipelines that, while precise, are prohibitively slow. We introduce FlowLensing, a Diffusion Transformer-based compact and efficient flow-matching model for strong gravitational lensing simulation. FlowLensing operates in both discrete and continuous regimes, handling classes such as different dark matter models as well as continuous model parameters ensuring physical consistency. By enabling scalable simulations, our model can advance dark matter studies, specifically for probing dark matter substructure in cosmological surveys. We find that our model achieves a speedup of over 200$\times$ compared to classical simulators for intensive dark matter models, with high fidelity and low inference latency. FlowLensing enables rapid, scalable, and physically consistent image synthesis, offering a practical alternative to traditional forward-modeling pipelines.
#### Probing Anisotropic Cosmic Birefringence with Foreground-Marginalised SPT B-mode Likelihoods

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we construct foreground-marginalised versions of the SPT-3G D1 and SPTpol cosmic microwave background (CMB) B-mode polarisation likelihoods. The compression is performed using the CMB-lite framework and we use the resulting data sets to constrain anisotropic cosmic birefringence, parametrised by the amplitude of a scale-invariant anisotropic birefringence spectrum, $A_{\rm CB}$. Using the new SPT-3G data we report a $95\%$ upper limit on $A_{\rm CB}$ of $ 1.2\times 10^{-4}$, which tightens to $0.53\times 10^{-4}$ when imposing a prior on the amplitude of gravitational lensing based on CMB lensing reconstruction analyses. These are the tightest constraints on anisotropic birefringence from BB power spectrum measurements to-date, demonstrating the constraining power of the South Pole Telescope.

 - **Abstract**
 Combinations of galaxy surveys and cosmic microwave background secondaries, such as the thermal Sunyaev Zeldovich (tSZ) effect, are increasingly being used to jointly constrain cosmology and astrophysical properties of the gas within and beyond halos. Standard cross-correlations measure a directionless correlation between the microwave maps and galaxy catalogs. However, more information about the cosmic web structure can be captured by summary statistics which include environmental constraints and measure oriented correlations along axes of structure, such as filaments or superclusters. This work studies the sensitivity of multipole moments of constrained oriented stacks, a directional and environmentally-dependent statistic, to variations in cosmological and astrophysical parameters. We run nine different 2.4 Gpc-per-side simulations with the Websky algorithm, varying the dark matter energy density within flat $\Lambda$CDM, and create mock tSZ maps with each. We also apply six different gas prescriptions, imitating AGN feedback variations, to the fiducial cosmology. We analyze oriented stacks of the tSZ signal in supercluster regions in each simulation, focusing on signal out to $\sim20$ transverse Mpc from massive ($M>5\times10^{13}~M_\odot$) halos. The cosmology variations affect anisotropic and isotropic measurements similarly, while the halo-pasted gas variations mostly affect the isotropic signal. Our results suggest it is worthwhile to incorporate directional information into SZ-galaxy cross-correlations to increase cosmological sensitivity and help break degeneracies with gas physics.
#### Mephisto: Self-Improving Large Language Model-Based Agents for Automated Interpretation of Multi-band Galaxy Observations

 - **Abstract**
 Astronomical research has long relied on human expertise to interpret complex data and formulate scientific hypotheses. In this study, we introduce Mephisto -- a multi-agent collaboration framework powered by large language models (LLMs) that emulates human-like reasoning for analyzing multi-band galaxy observations. Mephisto interfaces with the CIGALE codebase (a library of spectral energy distribution, SED, models) to iteratively refine physical models against observational data. It conducts deliberate reasoning via tree search, accumulates knowledge through self-play, and dynamically updates its knowledge base. Validated across diverse galaxy populations -- including the James Webb Space Telescope's recently discovered "Little Red Dot" galaxies -- we show that Mephisto demonstrates proficiency in inferring the physical properties of galaxies from multi-band photometry, positioning it as a promising research copilot for astronomers. Unlike prior black-box machine learning approaches in astronomy, Mephisto offers a transparent, human-aligned reasoning process that integrates seamlessly with existing research practices. This work underscores the possibility of LLM-driven agent-based research for astronomy, establishes a foundation for fully automated, end-to-end artificial intelligence (AI)-powered scientific workflows, and unlocks new avenues for AI-augmented discoveries in astronomy.
#### A first look at quasar-galaxy clustering at $z\simeq7.3$

 - **Abstract**
 We present JWST observations of the environments surrounding two high-redshift quasars -- J0252$-$0503 at $z = 7.0$ and J1007$+$2115 at $z = 7.5$ -- which enable the first constraints on quasar-galaxy clustering at $z \sim 7.3$. Galaxies in the vicinity of the quasars are selected through ground-based and JWST/NIRCam imaging and then spectroscopically confirmed with JWST/NIRSpec using the multi-shutter assembly (MSA). Over both fields, we identify 51 $z>5$ galaxies, of which eight are found within a $\Delta v_{\textrm{LOS}}=\pm1500 \rm{km} \rm{s}^{-1}$ line-of-sight velocity window from the quasars and another eight in the background. The galaxy J0252\_8713, located just $7\,\rm{pkpc}$ and $\Delta v_{\textrm{LOS}} \approx 360\,\rm{km}\,\rm{s}^{-1}$ from quasar J0252$-$0503, emerges as a compelling candidate for one of the most distant quasar-galaxy mergers. Combining the galaxy discoveries over the two fields, we measure the quasar-galaxy cross-correlation and obtain a correlation length of $r_0^{\rm{QG}}\approx7.6_{-1.6}^{+1.7}\,h^{-1}\,\rm{cMpc}$, based on a power-law model with a fixed slope of $\gamma_{\rm{QG}} = 2.0$. Under the assumption that quasars and galaxies trace the same underlying dark matter density fluctuations, we infer a minimum dark matter halo mass for $z\simeq7.3$ quasars of $\log_{10}(M_{\textrm{halo, min}}/\textrm{M}_{\odot})= 11.6\pm0.6$ in a halo model framework. Compared to measurements from EIGER at $\langle z \rangle = 6.25$ and ASPIRE at $\langle z \rangle = 6.7$ (where $\log_{10}(M_{\textrm{halo, min}}/\textrm{M}_{\odot}) \gtrsim 12.3$), our clustering results provide tentative evidence for a non-monotonic redshift evolution of quasar clustering properties. We further estimate a quasar duty cycle of $f_{\rm{duty}}\approx0.1\%$, consistent with constraints from quasar proximity zones and IGM damping wings. (abridged)
#### The dark sector of the Universe as a scalar field in Horndeski Gravity

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08459

 - **Abstract**
 In the present work, we study a subclass of Horndeski gravity characterized by a non-minimal derivative coupling between a scalar field and the Einstein tensor, as a possible alternative to alleviate the observational tension associated with estimates of the Hubble constant $H_{0}$. Two scenarios within a flat FRW spacetime were considered. In the first case, the scalar field mimics cold dark matter, whereas in the second case, it acts as dark energy. We derive the dynamical equations and perform a statistical analysis using observational data of $H(z)$, obtaining constraints for the cosmological parameters. The results indicate that the model can effectively fit the cosmic expansion rate at late epochs, providing values of $H_{0}$ that are more compatible with local measurements. These results suggest that the non-minimal coupling sector in the Horndeski context constitutes a viable and promising approach to alleviate the $H_{0}$ tension and investigate scenarios beyond the standard cosmological model.

 - **Abstract**
 We construct a neural network to perform regression on the local dark-matter density field given line-of-sight peculiar velocities of dark-matter halos, biased tracers of the dark matter field. Our architecture combines a convolutional U-Net with a point-cloud DeepSets. This combination enables efficient use of small-scale information and improves reconstruction quality relative to a U-Net-only approach. Specifically, our hybrid network recovers both clustering amplitudes and phases better than the U-Net on small scales.
