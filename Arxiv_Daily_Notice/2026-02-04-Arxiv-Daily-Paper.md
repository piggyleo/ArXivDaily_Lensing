#### Degeneracies and modelling choices in double-plane time-delay cosmography

 - **Abstract**
 Double-plane gravitational lensing is a rare but increasingly observed phenomenon in which the light from a distant source is lensed by two foreground objects at different redshifts. Such systems can be used to provide simultaneous constraints on the Hubble constant $H_0$ and the dark-energy equation of state, independent of and complementary to other probes. However, just as for single-plane gravitational lenses, the precision of these constraints is limited by the so-called mass-sheet degeneracy (MSD) -- a fundamental limit to the knowledge of the mass profiles of lens galaxies and the line of sight that can be obtained from imaging constraints alone. In this work, we show explicitly how contributions from the line of sight appear in double-plane systems. Because these contributions modify angular diameter distances, we argue that cosmological priors should not be used to simply fix the ``cosmological scaling factor'', a ratio of angular diameter distances which is key to the modelling of double-plane lenses. Motivated by this fact, we generalise the double-plane MSD to account for this uncertainty in the scaling factor. While this complicates the time-delay function, we show that, using the ``unfolding relation'', a geometric relation between distances which holds even in the presence of line-of-sight corrections, the uncertainty in the Hubble constant reduces to the familiar mass-sheet transformation of the first lens plane, and a line-of-sight contribution between the observer and the second lens plane. Our main message is therefore a prescription for reducing the degrees of freedom within double-plane models, while still safely accounting for the MSD in measurements of $H_0$.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we explore several ways to detect possible exocomet transits in the TESS (The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) light curves. The first one has been presented in our previous work, a machine learning approach based on the Random Forest algorithm. It was trained on asymmetric transit profiles calculated as a result of the modelling of a comet transit, and then applied to real star light curves from Sector 1 of TESS. This allowed us to detect 32 candidates with weak and non-periodic brightness dips that may correspond to comet-like events. The aim of this work is to analyse the events identified by the visual inspection to make sure that the features detected were not caused by instrumental effects. The second approach to detect possible exocomet transits, which is proposed, is an independent statistical method to test the results of the machine learning algorithm and to look for asymmetric minima directly in the light curves. This approach was applied to \b{eta} Pictoris light curves using TESS data from Sectors 5, 6, 32, and 33. The algorithm reproduced nearly all previously known events deeper than 0.03 % of the star flux, showing that it is efficient to detect shallow and irregular flux changes in the different sectors of the TESS data and at the different levels of noise. The combination of machine learning, visual inspection, and statistical analysis facilitates the identification of faint and short-lived asymmetric transits in photometric data. Although the number of confirmed exocomet transits is still small, the growing amount of observations points to their likely presence in many young planetary systems.

 - **Abstract**
 High-redshift quasars have been an excellent tracer to study the astrophysics and cosmology at early Universe. Using 216,949 high-redshift quasar candidates ($5.0 \leq z < 6.3$) selected via machine learning from the Legacy Survey Data Release 9 and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, we perform wide-field clustering analysis to investigate the large-scale environment of those high-redshift quasars. We construct the projected auto correlation function of those high-redshift quasars that is weighted by its predicted probability of being a true high-redshift quasar, from which we derive the bias parameter and the typical dark matter halo mass of those quasars. The dark matter halo mass of quasars estimated from the projected auto correlation function is $\log(M_h/M_{\odot})=12.2 ^{+0.2}_{-0.7}$ ($11.9^{+0.3}_{-0.7}$), with the bias parameter $b$ of $12.34 ^{+4.26}_{-4.37}$ ($11.52^{+4.02}_{-4.14}$) for the redshift interval of $5.0 \leq z <5.7$ ($5.7 \leq z <6.3$). Our results, combined with other measurements of dark matter halo masses for quasars or active galactic nucleus which obtain a lower dark matter halo mass of $\sim 10^{11.5}$ M$_\odot$ at similar redshift, suggest a more complex, and possibly non-monotonic evolution of quasar hosting dark matter halo. Moreover, we estimate the duty cycle of those quasars, which is $0.008^{+0.135}_{-0.007}$ ($0.003+^{+0.047}_{-0.003}$) for the redshift interval of $5.0 \leq z <5.7$ ($5.7 \leq z <6.3$).
#### The approximate gravitational lensing multiple plane mass sheet degeneracy

 - **Abstract**
 Strong gravitational lensing has to deal with many modeling degeneracies, the most notable being the Mass Sheet Degeneracy (MSD). We review the MSD when one needs to model more lens planes, each one with an internal mass sheet. We take into account the non-linear lens-lens coupling and line of sight effects, the latter treated as external mass sheets with associated shear. If second order shear terms on external and internal mass sheets can be neglected, we show that the MSD is always retained, and the mass sheets influence can be reabsorbed in the redefinition of angular diameter distances. In particular, internal and external mass sheets can be placed on the same footing. The version of the MSD discussed here does not require any particular relation between the internal mass sheets in the different planes. Even when including time delays from all sources, a residual degeneracy involving time delays, mass sheets and $ H_0 $ remains. We develop a framework which shows what can actually be constrained in multiple plane lens systems.

 - **Abstract**
 We combine Gaia Data Release 3 and artificial intelligence to enhance the current statistics of substellar companions, particularly within regions of the orbital period vs. mass parameter space that remain poorly constrained by the radial velocity and transit detection methods. Using supervised learning, we train a deep neural network to recognise the characteristic distribution of the fit quality statistics corresponding to a Gaia DR3 astrometric solution for a non single star. We generate a deep learning model, ExoDNN, which predicts the probability of a DR3 source to host unresolved companions based on those fit quality statistics. Applying the predictive capability of ExoDNN to a volume limited sample of F,G,K and M stars from Gaia DR3, we have produced a list of 7414 candidate stars hosting companions. The stellar properties of these candidates, such as their mass and metallicity, are similar to those of the Gaia DR3 non single star sample. We also identify synergies with future observatories, such as PLATO, and we propose a follow up strategy with the intention of investigating the most promising candidates among those samples.

 - **Abstract**
 Line-Intensity Mapping (LIM) has emerged as a powerful technique for studying large-scale structure and the high-redshift universe, enabling three-dimensional maps of line emission across vast cosmological volumes. In this review, we summarize the LIM framework, its key scientific goals, and its future prospects. We describe the landscape of emission line tracers, theoretical modeling approaches, anticipated signals, and data-analysis methodologies. We also discuss experimental challenges, particularly those posed by astrophysical foregrounds, and review possible mitigation strategies. Further, we highlight a range of cross-correlation science cases, linking LIM with other cosmological surveys. Finally, we summarize current and upcoming experiments and early results, including recent first detections, while outlining the outlook for future discoveries. Specifically, LIM may offer new insights into galaxy formation and evolution and cosmology, while revealing the Epoch of Reionization, Cosmic Dawn, and possibly the Cosmic Dark Ages. LIM enables cosmological measurements that complement other probes and provide unique access to the high-redshift universe, potentially shedding light on dark matter, dark energy, and cosmic inflation.

 - **Abstract**
 Cluster environments influence galaxy evolution by curtailing star formation activity, notably through ram-pressure stripping (RPS). In this study, using spatially resolved spectroscopic data from the SAMI Galaxy Survey, we identify galaxies undergoing or recently affected by RPS in eight nearby clusters ($0.029 < z < 0.058$), through a visual classification scheme based on the ionised gas ($\rm H\alpha + [NII]\lambda 6584$) morphologies, split into unperturbed, asymmetric, and truncated. The projected phase-space analysis shows that asymmetric galaxies are found in a narrow region in cluster-centric distance ($\rm 0.1 < R/R_{200} < 0.6$) and have a larger dispersion in line-of-sight velocity ($\sigma(|v_{pec}|)_\mathrm{Asym} = 0.71^{+0.09}_{-0.07}\ \sigma_{200}$) compared to the truncated and unperturbed samples. In terms of star formation activity, RPS candidates yield a much steeper resolved star-forming main sequence (rSFMS; $\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR} - \Sigma_\ast$) relation compared to the unperturbed counterparts, primarily emerging from having lower $\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR}$ values for the low mass density regime, with the steepest gradient deriving from the truncated sample. Moreover, radial star formation profiles reveal that star formation in RPS candidates is suppressed in the outskirts relative to unperturbed galaxies and is more prominent for the truncated sample. In contrast, central ($\rm r/r_{eff}<0.5$) star formation activity in RPS candidates is comparable with that in their unperturbed and field counterparts, suggesting no elevated activity. Taken together, this suggests an evolutionary trend linked to the RPS stage, where unperturbed galaxies likely represent recently accreted systems (pre-RPS), while asymmetric and truncated galaxies may correspond to populations undergoing RPS and post-RPS phases, respectively, favouring outside-in quenching.
#### Convolutional Neural Networks for classifying galaxy mergers: Can faint tidal features aid in classifying mergers?

 - **Abstract**
 Identifying mergers from observational data has been a crucial aspect of studying galaxy evolution and formation. Tidal features, typically fainter than 26 ${\rm mag\,arcsec^{-2}}$, exhibit a diverse range of appearances depending on the merger characteristics and are expected to be investigated in greater detail with the Rubin Observatory Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), which will reveal the low surface brightness universe with unprecedented precision. Our goal is to assess the feasibility of developing a convolutional neural network (CNN) that can distinguish between mergers and non-mergers based on LSST-like deep images. To this end, we used Illustris TNG50, one of the highest-resolution cosmological hydrodynamic simulations to date, allowing us to generate LSST-like mock images with a depth $\sim$ 29 ${\rm mag\,arcsec^{-2}}$ for low-redshift ($z=0.16$) galaxies, with labeling based on their merger status as ground truth. We focused on 151 Milky Way-like galaxies in field environments, comprising 81 non-mergers and 70 mergers. After applying data augmentation and hyperparameter tuning, a CNN model was developed with an accuracy of 65--67\%. Through additional image processing, the model was further optimized, achieving an accuracy of 67--70\% when trained on images containing only faint features. This represents an improvement of $\sim$ 5\% compared to training on images with bright features only. This suggests that faint tidal features can serve as effective indicators for distinguishing between mergers and non-mergers. The future direction for further improvement based on this study is also discussed.
