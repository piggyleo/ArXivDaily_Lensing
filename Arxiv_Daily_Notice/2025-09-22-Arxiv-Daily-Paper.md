 - **Abstract**
 We introduce the Fuzzy Dark Sector (FDS) scenario as a rich, interacting system and candidate for dark matter. This serves as a natural extension of the single-component, non-interacting Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) paradigm. Concretely, we consider an ultra-light Abelian-Higgs model, with interacting Higgs and dark photon degrees of freedom. We find that the transfer function, and hence imprint on the CMB and Large-Scale Structure (LSS), is characterized by a single characteristic scale of the interacting fuzzy dark sector, allowing us to recover the LSS signature of single-field FDM, dependent on the FDS parameters. In contrast, galactic halos present a great diversity, unlike with the universality of single-field FDM, owing to the interaction between fields. This interaction introduces an instability that is not otherwise present for the case of four decoupled scalars. Finally, we comment on primordial production and portals to the Standard Model, and introduce another simple realization of the Fuzzy Dark Sector paradigm with a kinetic coupling.
#### Kinematics of Stellar Streams from Globular Clusters Depend on Black Hole Retention and Star Mass: A Selection Effect for Dark Matter Inference

 - **Abstract**
 Velocity dispersion ($\sigma$) in stellar streams from globular clusters (GCs) is sensitive to heating by Galactic substructure, including dark matter (DM) subhalos. Recent studies have compared $\sigma$ in observed and modeled streams to probe DM properties, but have relied on stream models that neglect strong encounters, black holes (BHs), and mass segregation in GCs. Such phenomena may inflate stream $\sigma$ or introduce selection effects -- e.g., a $\sigma$ that depends on star mass ($m$). We investigate this prospect using Monte Carlo $N$-body simulations of GCs under static Galactic tides to generate mock streams with realistic mass and velocity distributions. We find $\sigma$ correlates with $m$, especially after core collapse (the GC's observable increase in central density upon ejecting its BHs), rising from $1.2$--$2.2\,{\rm km\,s}^{-1}$ between $m=0.3$--$0.8\,M_\odot$, with typical kinematic cuts on stream membership. Similar in magnitude to heating by Galactic substructure, this enhancement occurs because the GC's loss of BHs allows its most-massive stars to occupy its dense center, raising their likelihood of strong ejection via binary interactions and adding broad, exponential wings to the stream's velocity distribution. Streams' kinematics thus probe properties (density, BH retention) of their progenitor GCs. Our results also imply observations of streams from some GCs, especially those not subject to highly episodic mass loss, may select for higher $\sigma$ than predicted by models neglecting $\sigma$'s $m$-dependence. This would cause observed $\sigma$ in streams -- already on the low side of expectations for cold DM -- to further favor alternatives such as warm, ultralight, or self-interacting DM.

 - **Abstract**
 SDSS-V will obtain 100,000s of medium-resolution, optical spectra of M dwarfs with the BOSS instrument. M dwarfs have complex atmospheres, and their spectra contain many wide and dense, overlapping molecular features, so determining accurate stellar parameters by fitting models has been difficult. To circumvent this, other surveys have employed machine learning methods to transfer measurements of stellar parameters from high-resolution spectra to their medium-resolution counterparts. These methods provide large catalogs of stellar parameters but, if not addressed properly, are plagued by biases which are, in part, due to the normalization of the spectra. Typical spectral normalization removes the continuum but preserves the relative depths of the absorption features, but optical M dwarf spectra are almost entirely made up of molecular absorption, which makes this difficult. Here, we develop a standardization method that instead defines a pseudo-continuum. We use the spectrum's alpha shape to find the points which lie between the absorption features and apply local polynomial regression to find this pseudo-continuum. To tune the hyperparameters of this method, we create BOSS-like spectra from BT-NextGen models to replicate instrumental, signal-to-noise, and reddening effects. We find that in both this generated set and a validation set of the SDSS-V data, our method performs better than alternative standardizations by producing spectra that are both more uniform for M dwarfs with similar stellar parameters and more easily distinguished compared to M dwarfs of differing parameters. These results from our method will be crucial for better determining stellar parameters of M dwarfs using generative models.
#### WALLABY Pilot Survey: A gas-rich diffuse dwarf on the baryonic Tully Fisher relation

 - **Abstract**
 Diffuse dwarf galaxies, and particularly ultra diffuse galaxies (UDGs), challenge our understanding of galaxy formation and the role of dark matter due to their large sizes, low surface brightness, and varying dark matter content. In this work, we investigate the gas-rich diffuse dwarf galaxy WALLABY J125956-192430 (aka. KK176) using high-resolution HI data from the WALLABY survey. We produce the most reliable kinematic model for KK176 to date. Using this model, the derived mass decomposition shows that KK176 is dark matter dominated. We also place KK176 on the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (bTFR), finding that it is consistent with low-mass dwarf galaxies but distinctly different from reported dark matter-deficient UDGs.
#### Observation of the Galactic Center in the Sub-MeV Gamma-Ray Band with an Electron-Tracking Compton Camera

 - **Abstract**
 We report the first detection of gamma-ray emission from the Galactic center in the 150-600 keV band using a linear, imaging-spectroscopy approach used in common telescopes with an electron-tracking Compton camera (ETCC) aboard the SMILE-2+ balloon experiment. A one-day flight over Australia resulted in a significant gamma-ray detection in the light curve and revealed a $7.9\sigma$ excess in the image map from the Galactic center region. These results, obtained through a simple and unambiguous analysis, demonstrate the high reliability and sensitivity of the ETCC and establish its potential for future high-precision MeV gamma-ray observations. The measured intensity and spatial distribution were tested against three emission models: a single point-like source, a multi-component structure, and a symmetric two-dimensional Gaussian. All models were found to be statistically consistent with the data. The positronium-related flux in the multi-component model is $(3.2~\pm~1.4)~\times~10^{-2}$ photons cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$, which is approximately a factor of two higher than the value reported by INTEGRAL, with a discrepancy at the $2\sigma$ level. This difference may arise from unresolved sources or truly diffuse emission, such as exotic processes involving light dark matter or primordial black holes.
#### Fast and accurate Gaia-unWISE quasar mock catalogs from LPT and Eulerian bias

 - **Abstract**
 We present $100$ full-sky quasar spectrophotometric mock catalogs with smooth redshift evolution from $z=0$ to $z\sim 4$, tailored to analyze the Gaia-unWISE Quasar Catalog (Quaia). In particular, we apply a novel hierarchical nonlocal nonlinear bias scheme (Hicobian) to dark matter fields generated through Augmented Lagrangian Perturbation Theory on the lightcone (WebON code), calibrating the free parameters of the bias model on Abacus quasar HOD mock catalogs tuned to reproduce DESI Early Data Release observations in real and redshift space. After having obtained such accurate spectroscopic catalogs, we inject in the mocks the observational effects characterizing the Quaia catalog: (i) spectrophotometric redshift uncertainties, (ii) the angular selection function, and (iii) the redshift number counts distribution. We assess the accuracy of our catalogs by validating a number of summary statistics: the full-sky QSO maps, the redshift uncertainty distributions as a function of redshift, the redshift $n(z)$ distribution, the angular power spectra and their normalized covariance matrices, and the angular two-point correlation functions. We find excellent agreement between these metrics from the mocks and from the Quaia catalog. We publicly release the mock catalogs to the community.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new method to search for strong gravitational lensing systems by pairing spectra that are close together on the sky in a spectroscopic survey. We visually inspect 26,621 spectra in the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 1 that are selected in this way. We further inspect the 11,848 images corresponding to these spectra in the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys Data Release 10, and obtain 2046 conventional strong gravitational lens candidates, of which 1906 are new. This constitutes the largest sample of lens candidates identified to date in spectroscopic data. Besides the conventional candidates, we identify a new class of systems that we term "dimple lenses". These systems have a low-mass foreground galaxy as a lens, typically smaller in angular extent and fainter compared with the lensed background source galaxy, producing subtle surface brightness indentations in the latter. We report the discovery of 318 of these "dimple-lens" candidates. We suspect that these represent dwarf galaxy lensing. With follow-up observations, they could offer a new avenue to test the cold dark matter model by probing their mass profiles, stellar mass-halo mass relation, and halo mass function for $M_{\textrm{Halo}} \lesssim 10^{13}\,M_\odot$. Thus, in total, we report 2164 new lens candidates. Our method demonstrates the power of pairwise spectroscopic analysis and provides a pathway complementary to imaging-based and single-spectrum lens searches.
#### Two-phase formation of galaxies: the coevolution between galaxies and dark matter halos

 - **Abstract**
 We use FIRE-2 cosmological zoom-in hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the co-evolution between Milky Way-size galaxies and their host dark matter halos. We find that the formation of these galaxies follows a two-phase pattern, with an early phase featured by hot dynamics, bulge-dominated structure and bursty star formation, and a later phase featured by cold dynamics, disk-dominated structure and steady star formation. The transition times of these galaxy properties are tightly correlated with the time when the host halo transits from fast to slow accretion, suggesting that the two-phase assembly of halos drive the two-phase formation of galaxies. The physical origin of dynamical hotness can be summarized into two modes of star formation: a scattered mode in which stars form at large radii within cold gas streams associated with fast assembly of halos, and a concentrated mode in which stars form at small radii through violent fragmentation from globally self-gravitated gas when halo assembly is about to slow down. Cold gaseous and stellar disks can form only when the conditions of the two modes are removed by the stall of halo assembly and the reduction of gas by feedback processes. The two modes of star formation leave distinct imprints on the structural properties of high-redshift galaxies, providing implications to be tested by JWST and future observations.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore for the first time the possibility of detecting lensed star transients in galaxy-galaxy strong lensing systems upon repeated, deep imaging using the {\it James-Webb Space Telescope} ({\it JWST}). Our calculation predicts that the extremely high recent star formation rate of $\sim 100\,M_{\odot}\textrm{yr}^{-1}$ over the last 50 Myr (not accounting for image multiplicity) in the ``Cosmic Horseshoe'' lensed system ($z = 2.381$) generates many young, bright stars, of which their large abundance is expected to lead to a detection rate of $\sim 60$ transients per pointing in {\it JWST} observations with a $5\sigma$ limiting magnitude of $\sim 29\,m_{AB}$. With the high expected detection rate and little room for uncertainty for the lens model compared with cluster lenses, our result suggests that the Cosmic Horseshoe could be an excellent tool to test the nature of Dark Matter based on the spatial distribution of transients, and can be used to constrain axion mass if Dark Matter is constituted of ultra-light axions. We also argue that the large distance modulus of $\sim46.5\,$mag at $z \approx 2.4$ can act as a filter to screen out less massive stars as transients and allow one to better constrain the high-mass end of the stellar initial mass function based on the transient detection rate. Follow-up {\it JWST} observations of the Cosmic Horseshoe with would allow one to better probe the nature of Dark Matter and the star formation properties, such as the initial mass function at the cosmic noon, via lensed star transients.
#### Unified dark fluid with null sound speed as an alternative to phantom dark energy

 - **Abstract**
 Recent BAO measurements from DESI, when combined with CMB and supernovae data, suggest evolving dark energy and in particular point to a possible phantom regime, with an equation of state parameter $w<-1$. We explore an alternative phenomenological way to model dark matter and dark energy based on a unified dark fluid (UDF). By construction, our model reproduces the same background expansion history as DESI's best-fit using the CPL parametrization, but assumes a vanishing rest-frame sound speed and no anisotropic stress. This simple prescription ensures a consistent and physical treatment of perturbations, and the use of a unified dark sector avoids phantom behaviour by construction. We model CMB, LSS, and redshift-space distortion observables, and find differences with CPL that are typically at the few-percent level. As a result, we forecast that even stage IV CMB and galaxy surveys will have limited power to discriminate between our UDF and CPL at the linear level. At the non-linear level, we study spherical collapse in the UDF and show that within this framework, structure formation proceeds very similarly to standard scenarios. Using Planck, DESI BAO DR2, and DESY5 supernovae data, we demonstrate that this simple UDF model fits current observations nearly as well as CPL, while treating perturbations consistently. Because most cosmological observations are not sensitive to how the dark sector is split, the unified framework can also approximate the phenomenology of interacting dark energy-dark matter scenarios or evolving dark matter, making it a general way to model the data, at least as long as the dark components have a vanishing sound speed, which is the most distinctive feature of our analysis. This highlights that a unified dark fluid with evolving equation of state and null sound speed is sufficient to pass current constraints without a phantom component.
