 - **Abstract**
 Measurements of the mean free path of ionizing photons from high-redshift quasar spectra at $z \sim 5$-$6$ constrain the reionization history, but interpreting them requires modeling the kiloparsec-scale clumping that large-volume reionization simulations cannot resolve. We present a deep learning emulator for the mean free path (MFP) trained on high-resolution cosmological radiative transfer simulations of ionization fronts sweeping through small 2 comoving~Mpc/h volumes. Using a residual multi-layer perceptron neural network, we predict the MFP at a given redshift as a function of the reionization redshift, photoionization rate, wavelength, and box-scale density, achieving a median relative error of 1.6\% across nearly four orders of magnitude in MFP. Integrating its predictions over box-scale overdensity and an extended reionization history allows the emulator to predict the global MFP. We apply the emulator to extended reionization histories constrained by observed photoionization rates, finding that models prefer late reionization with substantial neutral fractions persisting at $z \lesssim 6$. Fitting a parametric ionization history yields a midpoint of reionization of $z_{\rm re} = 6.8\pm 1.2$ for reionization durations consistent with Planck and kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich constraints, and the universe being $10\%$ neutral still at $z_{\rm re} < 5.8 ~(6.3)$ at 1~(2)$\sigma$. Global ionizing emissivity inferences using measurements of the photoionization rate and MFP plus our emulator, which avoids common power-law assumptions, suggest a factor of $2-3$ decline between $z = 6$ and $4.8$, in agreement with previous studies. Our method provides an efficient (and more converged) alternative to large-volume radiative-hydrodynamic simulations of reionization for interpreting MFP measurements, and can also serve as a subgrid prescription for the ionizing opacity within such simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 Principled Bayesian inference of galaxy properties has not previously been performed for wide-area weak lensing surveys with millions of sources. We address this gap by applying the pop-cosmos generative model to perform spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting for 4 million KiDS-1000 galaxies. Calibrated on deep COSMOS2020 photometric data, pop-cosmos specifies a physically-motivated prior over the galaxy population up to $z \simeq 6$ in stellar population synthesis (SPS) parameter space. Using the Speculator SPS emulator with GPU-accelerated MCMC sampling, we perform full posterior inference at 6.5 GPU seconds per galaxy, obtaining joint constraints on galaxy redshifts and physical properties. We validate photometric redshifts against $\sim\!185,\!000$ KiDS galaxies cross-matched to DESI DR1 spectroscopic samples, achieving low bias ($3\times10^{-3}$), scatter ($\sigma_{\mathrm{MAD}}=0.04$), and outlier fraction (3.7%) for the Bright Galaxy Survey, with comparable performance (bias $3\times10^{-2}$, $\sigma_{\mathrm{MAD}}=0.05$, 1.3% outliers) for luminous red galaxies (LRGs). Within the LRG sample, we identify massive, dusty, star-forming contaminants at $z \simeq 0.4$ satisfying standard colour selections for quenched populations. We infer trends in stellar mass, star formation, metallicity, and dust across five tomographic redshift bins consistent with established scaling relations. Using specific star formation rate constraints, we identify $\sim$10% of KiDS-1000 galaxies as quenched, versus 37% implied by conservative colour cuts. This enables the construction of weak lensing samples defined by physical properties while mitigating intrinsic alignment systematics and preserving statistical power. Our analysis validates pop-cosmos out-of-sample, establishing it as a scaleable approach for galaxy evolution and cosmological analyses in photometric surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 The circumgalactic medium (CGM) of the Milky Way is composed of a tenuous atmosphere filled with multi-phase plasma, including a warm-hot virialised component. Recent studies suggest a much hotter (~0.7 keV) super-virial component detected in both absorption and emission. We want to shed light on the nature of this putative super-virial component. We analysed the X-ray background as observed by SRG/eROSITA over the entire western Galactic hemisphere. We show that low-mass stars provide a large fraction of the 0.7 keV emission. Indeed, a tight correlation is found between the surface brightness of the 0.7 keV emission and the mass distribution of the Milky Way across a large portion of the western Galactic hemisphere. The correlation coefficient implies an X-ray luminosity per unit of stellar mass comparable to that of the average low-mass stars within 10 pc of the Sun, suggesting that unresolved M dwarfs and F, G, and K type stars dominate the 0.7 keV emission. This emission is asymmetric with respect to the Galactic plane, influenced by the asymmetric distribution of nearby star-forming regions, and broadly consistent with the known offset of the Sun above the Galactic midplane. The remaining signal might be produced by the cumulative emission of stars of different types or ages, in addition to other sources (e.g. hot interstellar medium, Galactic corona, etc.). Assuming that the putative residual hot super-virial atmosphere is homogeneous and has a spherical beta profile with slope $\beta=0.4$, we constrain its density at 10 kpc to be $n_e<4\times10^{-4}$~cm$^{-3}$. Our findings may help refine models of the circumgalactic medium around external galaxies, advancing our understanding of hot baryon flows and galaxy evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 The velocity correlation functions directly measured from the peculiar velocity field of dark matter in numerical simulations are known to have an amplitude lower than that predicted by theoretical models at large scales. The trend persists for dark-matter halos or galaxies that are more closely related to the observables. We investigate the impact of the finite simulation box sizes on the measured velocity correlation functions of halos, utilizing N-body simulations with different box sizes. We measure the halo velocity correlations from N-body simulations with side lengths of $1{\rm Gpc}/h$ and $2{\rm Gpc}/h$, confirming the former is more suppressed compared to the linear theory prediction on large scales due to the lack of large-scale modes beyond the box size. In contrast, even though we subdivide the larger-box simulations into those with side lengths of $1{\rm Gpc}/h$, the amount of the suppression is the same as that from the original boxes, as the large-scale modes are already imprinted. Introducing the lower limit of the integral in the Hankel transform, $k_{\rm min}$, as a free parameter and marginalizing it over, we find that the constrained growth rate parameter, $f(z)\sigma_8(z)$, returns the correct value assumed in the simulations. However, when we ignore the effect and set $k_{\rm min}=0$, the constraint on $f\sigma_8$ is significantly biased if the correlation between different separation bins is also ignored. Furthermore, we find that the suppression of the velocity correlation amplitude on large scales depends on halo mass, with more massive halos exhibiting a systematically stronger suppression. These results highlight the importance of accounting for missing long-wavelength modes when developing simulation-based modeling of velocity statistics, such as emulators.
