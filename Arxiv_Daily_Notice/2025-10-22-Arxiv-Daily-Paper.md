#### Growth of Structure in Multi-species Wave Dark Matter

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the growth of structure in multi-species wave (and particle) dark matter. We derive the evolution of the power spectrum of total density contrasts for an arbitrary number of component species, density fractions, and initial field power spectra. We also derive cross-spectra for density correlations across or within individual species. Our framework includes cold and warm wave dark matter, which can give rise to significant intrinsic Poisson-like density fluctuations along with scale-dependent evolution connected to the free-streaming and Jeans scales. Such dark matter components could be globally or locally misaligned scalar fields as well as multi-component fields with spin $>0$. The framework also includes cold and warm particle dark matter in the appropriate limits.

 - **Abstract**
 Hydrodynamic simulations have proposed that stellar feedback and bursty star-formation can produce dark matter cores in low-mass galaxies. A key prediction is that feedback-driven gas outflow and inflow cycles can lead to ``breathing modes'' (rapid fluctuations in the global gravitational potential) which drive correlated variations in galaxy size, kinematics, and star-formation rate. In this paper, we test the dynamical effects of feedback-driven breathing modes using a sample of 103 star-forming low-mass galaxies with stellar masses between $7.9<\rm \log M_*/M_\odot<9.6$ and $0.02<z<0.19$. We measure ionized gas velocity dispersions from H$\alpha$ emission lines and compare them to mock observations from the FIRE-2 simulations. We compare gas velocity dispersions ($\rm \sigma_{gas}$), stellar masses, and specific star-formation rates (sSFR). We find a positive correlation between gas velocity dispersion residuals at fixed stellar masses ($\rm \Delta\sigma_{gas}$) and sSFR in both data and simulations. However, the relation is tighter in FIRE-2 compared to the data. FIRE-2 produces more low-sSFR galaxies compared to our observational sample, however, the sSFR distributions agree after limiting both samples to a minimum sSFR. A deeper and more complete photometric sample further indicates that observed low-mass galaxies could span the full range of sSFR predicted in the FIRE-2 simulations. Our results support the existence of short-timescale dynamical effects driven by gas outflow and inflow cycles in low-mass galaxies and motivate additional tests of the breathing mode.
#### Milky Way Mass Through Escape Velocity Curve from LAMOST K Giants

Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)

 - **Abstract**
 Escape velocity has long been used to constrain the mass of the Dark Matter (DM) halo in the Milky Way (MW). Here we present a study of the escape velocity curve using a sample of high-velocity K giants with full 6D phase-space information and relatively good quality, selected from LAMOST DR8 and cross-matched with Gaia DR3. To expand the high-velocity stars to larger distances, we used radius-dependent criteria of total velocity, that is, $v_{\rm GC}>300\;\rm{km s^{-1}}$ for the solar neighborhood; $v_{\rm GC}>v_{\rm min}\sim0.6\times v_{\rm esc}(r_{\rm GC})$ for outer region. We also selected halo stars based on $v_{\phi}-{\rm [Fe/H]}$ information to ensure that the sample is isotropic. We modeled the velocity distribution with traditional power-law models to determine the escape velocity in each radial bin. For the first time, we have directly measured a relatively continuous escape velocity curve that can extend to Galactocentric radii of $\sim 50$ kpc, finding a decline in agreement with previous studies. The escape velocity at the solar position yielded by our measurements is $523.74^{+12.83}_{-13.47}\;\rm{km s^{-1}}$. Combined with the local circular velocity, we estimated the mass of the MW assuming a Navarro-Frenk-White DM profile, which resulted in a total mass of $M_{200,\;\rm{total}}=0.90_{-0.07}^{+0.06}\times 10^{12}\;M_{\odot}$, with a concentration of $c_{200}=13.47_{-1.70}^{+1.85}$. The small uncertainty implies that including the escape velocities beyond the solar neighborhood can result in a more precise mass estimate. Our derived MW mass is consistent with some recent studies using the escape velocity as well as other tracers, which may support a lower mass of the DM halo than in the past.
#### The $\mathtt{WebSky}$ $\mathrm{[CII]}$ Forecasts and the search for primordial intermittent non-Gaussianity
 - **Authors:** Nathan J. Carlson, J. Richard Bond, Dongwoo T. Chung, Patrick Horlaville, Thomas Morrison
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18312

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.18312

 - **Abstract**
 We present the $\mathtt{WebSky}$ $\mathrm{[CII]}$ line-intensity mock maps and forecast the capabilities of upcoming wide-field submillimeter-wave surveys of cosmological $\mathrm{[CII]}$ emission from the epoch of reionization (EoR). Using the $\mathtt{Peak~Patch}$ algorithm to generate light-cone dark matter (DM) halo catalogues and the $\mathtt{WebSky}$ framework to forward-model the cosmological $\mathrm{[CII]}$ signal, we construct tomographic mock surveys matched to the CCAT Observatory. We investigate both astrophysical models of $\mathrm{[CII]}$ emission from interstellar gas and the potential for the study of primordial intermittent non-Gaussianity (PING) as a science case for Stage 2 line intensity mapping (LIM) surveys. The $\mathrm{[CII]}$ voxel intensity distribution (VID) is used as a summary statistic in forecasts. Additional constraints on PING are derived from a relative entropy study of $\mathtt{Peak~Patch}$ halo mass functions. We show that upcoming LIM surveys will provide insights into the way we model cosmological line emission, and next-generation surveys can place competitive bounds on novel inflationary scenarios such as PING. The $\mathtt{WebSky}$ $\mathrm{[CII]}$ mocks and corresponding $\mathtt{Peak~Patch}$ halo catalogues are publicly available at this https URL .
#### N-body Simulations of cosmologies with Light Massive Relics
 - **Authors:** Vikhyat Sharma, Arka Banerjee
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18797

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.18797

 - **Abstract**
 The presence of additional relativistic particles at the time of recombination can be inferred through their contribution to $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$. If these species have a finite but low mass (Light Massive Relics - LiMRs), they act as a hot subcomponent of dark matter and impact late-time structure formation. Understanding these effects will be crucial to pin down the underlying particle physics properties of any future $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ detection. While their impact has been well-studied on linear scales, this work develops the framework for and presents results from the first set of cosmological N-body simulations that can track the effects of LiMRs, as a function of their mass and temperature, down to fully nonlinear scales. Importantly, our simulations model the impact of both the massive Standard Model neutrinos and LiMRs, which will be crucial in disentangling possible degeneracies. We systematically explore the effects of LiMR properties such as mass, temperature, and initial distribution, on various cosmological observables, including the total matter power spectrum, Halo Mass Functions (HMF), Mass-Concentration relation, radial halo profiles, and weak lensing signals around massive clusters. The framework and simulations developed here will enable detailed follow-up of the rich phenomenology of LiMR cosmologies.
