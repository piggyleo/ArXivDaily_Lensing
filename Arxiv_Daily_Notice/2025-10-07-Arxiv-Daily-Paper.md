#### The LMC Corona as Evidence for a First Passage
 - **Authors:** Scott Lucchini, Jiwon Jesse Han, Sapna Mishra, Andrew J. Fox
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)

 - **Abstract**
 We use constrained idealized simulations of the LMC/Milky Way interaction to determine if the size of the LMC's gaseous halo (Corona) can be used to distinguish between first and second passage models $-$ an orbital trajectory for the LMC in which it has just recently approached the Milky Way for the first time (first passage), or one in which it has had a previous pericenter (second passage). Using live circumgalactic gas particles combined with analytic dark matter potentials evolved to follow previously published orbital trajectories, we find that the first passage model is able to reproduce the observed velocity profile and column density profile of the present day LMC Corona. On the other hand, in a second passage scenario the longer interaction time leads to the velocities and column densities around the LMC at the present day being too low. Based on this observed velocity profile, recent works have found that the LMC's Corona has been truncated to 17$-$20 kpc, and we find truncation radii of $15.3\pm 0.9$ kpc and $7.6\pm 2.0$ kpc for the first and second passage models, respectively. Thus, based on the gas properties of the LMC's CGM at the present day, a second passage trajectory is disfavored.
#### On the Frequency of Multiple Galaxy Mergers in $Λ$CDM Cosmological Simulations

 - **Abstract**
 Mergers are believed to play a pivotal role in galaxy evolution, and measuring the galaxy merger fraction is a longstanding goal of both observational and theoretical studies. In this work, we extend the consideration of the merger fraction from the standard measure of binary mergers, namely those comprising two merging galaxies, to multiple mergers, namely mergers involving three or more galaxies. We use the Illustris and IllustrisTNG cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to provide a theoretical prediction for the fraction of galaxy systems that are involved in a multiple merger as a function of various parameters, with a focus on the relationship between the multiple merger fraction $f_m$ and the total merger fraction $f_t$. We generally find that binary mergers dominate the total fraction and that $f_m\approx (0.5-0.7)f_t^{5/3}$, a prediction that can be tested observationally. We further compare the empirical simulation results with toy models where mergers occur, on the evolution timeline of a galaxy, either at constant intervals or as a Poisson process at a constant rate. From these comparisons, where the toy models typically produce lower multiple merger fractions, we conclude that in cosmological simulations, mergers are more strongly clustered in time than in these toy scenarios, likely reflecting the hierarchical nature of cosmological structure formation.
#### Woven by the Whirls: The growth and entrainment of cold clouds in turbulent hot winds

 - **Abstract**
 Galactic and intergalactic flows often exhibit relative motion between the cold dense gas and the hot diffuse medium. Such multiphase flows -- involving gas at different temperatures, densities, and ionization states -- for instance, galactic winds, are frequently turbulent. However, idealized simulations typically model the winds and driven turbulence separately, despite their intertwined roles in galaxy evolution. To address this, we investigate the survival of a dense cloud in a hot wind subject to continuous external turbulent forcing. We perform 3D hydrodynamic simulations across a range of turbulent Mach numbers in the hot phase $\mathcal{M}_{\rm turb}=v_{\rm turb}/c_{\rm s, wind}$ from 0.1 to 0.7 ($c_{\rm s, wind}$ and $v_{\rm turb}$ being the sound speed and the turbulent velocity in the hot phase, respectively). We find that in spite of the additional subsonic turbulence, cold clouds can survive if the cooling time of the mixed gas $t_{\rm cool, mix}$ is shorter than a modified destruction time $\tilde{t}_{\rm cc}$, i.e., $t_{\rm cool,mix}/\tilde{t}_{\rm cc}<1$ where $\tilde{t}_{\rm cc}=t_{\rm cc}/(1+\left(\mathcal{M}_{\rm turb}/\left(f_{\rm mix}\mathcal{M}_{\rm wind}\right)\right)^2)^{1/2}$, where $f_{\rm mix}\sim0.6$ is a fudge factor. Moreover, in the `survival regime', turbulence can enhance the growth of cold clouds by up to an order of magnitude because of more efficient stretching and an associated increase in the surface area. This increase in mass transfer between the phases leads to significantly faster entrainment of cold material in turbulent winds. In contrast to the narrow filamentary tails formed in laminar winds, turbulence stretches the cold gas orthogonally, dispersing it over a larger area and changing absorption line signatures.
#### Revisiting Gaussian Process Reconstruction for Cosmological Inference: The Generalised GP (Gen GP) Framework

Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03742

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.03742

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate uncertainties in the estimation of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) arising from Gaussian Process (GP) reconstruction, demonstrating that the choice of kernel introduces systematic variations comparable to those arising from different cosmological models. To address this limitation, we introduce the Generalized Gaussian Process (Gen GP) framework, in which the Matérn smoothness parameter $\nu$ is treated as a free parameter, allowing for data-driven kernel optimization. Using the cosmic chronometer Hubble data, we find that while standard GP with $\Lambda$CDM mean function exhibits noticeable reconstruction differences between optimized and marginalized approaches, particularly at $z > 1$, Gen GP maintains methodological consistency. In Gen GP, slight increases in $\chi^2$ per degree of freedom relative to standard GP, for both the zero-mean and $\Lambda$CDM prior mean cases, reflect added flexibility rather than performance degradation. Our results emphasize that robust cosmological inference requires treating kernel parameters as free variables and implementing full Bayesian marginalization to avoid artificial precision from fixed hyperparameters. As machine learning becomes central to cosmological discovery, the Gen GP framework provides a principled approach to model-independent inference that properly accounts for methodological uncertainties while maintaining necessary flexibility for reliable parameter estimation.
#### Analysis of Galaxies at the Extremes: Failed Galaxy Progenitors in the MAGNETICUM Simulations

 - **Abstract**
 There is increasing observational evidence for a failed galaxy formation pathway for some ultradiffuse galaxies (UDGs) at low redshift however they currently lack simulated counterparts. We attempt to identify dark matter halos at high redshift within the MAGNETICUM cosmological simulations that could plausibly be their progenitors. We build a toy model of passive galaxy evolution within the stellar mass-halo mass relation to trace z = 0 observations of UDGs back to their z = 2 locations. We identify a population of 443 galaxies that match these parameter space positions within the simulation. We build two comparison samples within the simulation that follow the stellar mass-halo mass relationship at z = 2, one of which is stellar mass matched (with varying smaller halo masses) and the other is halo mass matched (with varying larger stellar masses) to our sample. We identify that our failed galaxy progenitor candidates have 1) flatter, cored dark matter halos; 2) more extended stellar bodies; 3) a larger fraction of their gas in the outskirts of their halos; 4) lower metallicities and 5) higher star formation rates than the control samples. Findings 1) and 2) are similar to low redshift observations of UDGs. Finding 3) will aid the removal of gas and permanent quenching of star formation which is a requirement of the failed galaxy formation scenario. The low metallicities of finding 4) match those observed in low redshift failed galaxy UDGs. Comparing the high star formation rates of finding 5) to recent JWST observations suggests that a starburst would naturally explain the high globular cluster richness of the UDGs. Many of the properties we find for these failed galaxy progenitors can be explained by an assembly bias of their dark matter halo to later formation times. We conclude by proposing that the fraction of failed galaxy UDGs is expected to increase with environmental density.
#### Suzaku observations of outskirts of nearby clusters and groups: I. electron density and gas fraction to the virial radius

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of Suzaku observations of 14 nearby galaxy clusters and groups (z < 0.06), extending radial coverage out to the virial radius (approximately r200). The sample spans a wide mass range, from M500 about 2x10^13 to 7x10^14 solar masses, and includes well-studied systems such as Coma, Perseus, and Virgo. We carefully modeled all background components, including the soft X-ray foregrounds (the Local Hot Bubble, Milky Way Halo, and super-virial temperature components), the cosmic X-ray background, and the non-X-ray background, and assessed their effects on the derived properties of the intracluster medium (ICM). We constructed radial profiles of emission measure, electron density, and temperature. Temperatures decrease smoothly with radius, typically dropping to about one-third to half of their peak values near r200. For relaxed clusters, the emission measure profiles outside the core regions are well described by a beta model with beta around 0.6-0.7, while groups show slightly flatter slopes of beta around 0.4-0.65. Beyond r2500, electron density profiles follow a power-law decline with a slope close to 2. At r500 and r200, the electron density and the gas mass fraction show a tight correlation with the system mass, except for three clusters with bright subclusters. In massive clusters, the gas fraction increases with radius and approaches the cosmic baryon fraction near r200. In contrast, lower-mass systems exhibit gas fractions of around 0.1 at r200. The observed mass dependence of gas fractions suggests that feedback and related processes play an increasingly important role toward the group scale, shaping the connection between baryons and dark matter halos.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Astronomical imaging aims to maximize signal capture while minimizing noise. Enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio directly on detectors is difficult and expensive, leading to extensive research in advanced post-processing techniques. Aims: Removing background noise from images is a valuable pre-processing step catalog-building tasks. We introduce BGRem, a machine learning (ML) based tool to remove background noise from astronomical images. Methods: BGRem uses a diffusion-based model with an attention U-Net as backbone, trained on simulated images for optical and gamma ({\gamma})-ray data from the MeerLICHT and Fermi-LAT telescopes. In a supervised manner, BGRem learns to denoise astronomical images over several diffusion steps. Results: BGRem performance was compared with a widely used tool for cataloging astronomical sources, SourceExtractor (SExtractor). It was shown that the amount of true positive sources using SExtractor increased by about 7% for MeerLICHT data when BGRem was used as a pre-processing step. We also show the generalizability of BGRem by testing it with optical images from different telescopes and also on simulated {\gamma}-ray data representative of the Fermi-LAT telescope. We show that in both cases, BGRem improves the source detection efficiency. Conclusions: BGRem can improve the accuracy in source detection of traditional pixel-based methods by removing complex background noise. Using zero-shot approach, BGRem can generalize well to a wide range of optical images. The successful application of BGRem to simulated {\gamma}-ray images, alongside optical data, demonstrates its adaptability to distinct noise characteristics and observational domains. This cross-wavelength performance highlights its potential as a general-purpose background removal framework for multi-wavelength astronomical surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 The infall of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) into the Milky Way (MW) has displaced the MW's centre of mass, manifesting as an observed reflex motion in the velocities of outer halo stars. We use a Simulation Based Inference framework to constrain properties of the MW, LMC and the induced reflex motion using the dynamics of outer MW halo stars. Specifically, we use the mean radial and tangential velocities of outer halo stars calculated in a set of distance and on-sky bins. We train neural networks to estimate parameter posterior distributions using a set of $128,000$ rigid MW--LMC simulations conditioned upon velocity data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and the combined H3+SEGUE+MagE outer halo surveys. We constrain the reflex motion velocity and the enclosed MW and LMC masses within $50 \, \rm kpc$ using the DESI or H3+SEGUE+MagE dataset while varying the survey sky coverage and depth. We find the most precise constraints by using the radial and tangential velocity data from the H3+SEGUE+MagE survey and on-sky quadrant sky coverages. We report a reflex motion velocity, the speed at which the MW lurches towards the LMC, of $v_{\rm{travel}} = 26.4^{+5.5}_{-4.4} \, \rm km \, \rm s^{-1}$, while simultaneously finding an enclosed LMC mass of $M_{\rm LMC}(< 50 \, \rm kpc) = 9.2^{+1.9}_{-2.3} \times 10^{10}\, \rm M_{\odot}$ and enclosed MW mass of $M_{\rm MW}(< 50 \, \rm kpc) = 4.4^{+0.7}_{-0.7} \times 10^{11}\, \rm M_{\odot}$. Our results suggest that the LMC's total mass is at least $\approx 10-15 \%$ of that of the MW. This inference framework is flexible such that it can provide rapid and reliable constraints when applied to any future survey measuring the velocities of outer halo stars.
