 - **Abstract**
 One of the main properties of galactic bars is their rotation (or pattern) speed, which is driven by both internal galactic properties, as well as external interactions. To assess the influence of these internal and external drivers on bar rotation in a cosmological setting, we use the Auriga suite of cosmological hydrodynamical zoom-in simulations. We calculate the bar pattern speed and the bar rotation rate - the ratio of corotation radius to bar length - at the time of bar formation and at z=0, and compare these to bar age, bar strength, baryon dominance, galaxy stellar mass, and the history of external galaxy interactions. We find that galaxies which are more baryon dominated at z=0 - and which lie above the observed stellar mass-halo mass abundance matching relation - host faster bars, while more dark matter dominated galaxies host slower bars. Baryon-dominated galaxies also form their bars earlier and their rotation rates stay constant or even decrease over time; this leads to older bars being faster than their younger counterparts - in contrast to the expectation of bar slow-down from dynamical friction imparted by the dark matter halo. We also find a trend in stellar mass, with 'faster' bars being hosted in more massive galaxies, which could be driven by the underlying higher baryon-dominance of more massive galaxies. Furthermore, we find that external interactions, such as mergers and flybys, correlate with lower bar rotation rates, particularly for strong interactions that occur around bar formation time. This correlation is relatively weak, leaving internal baryon-dominance as the main driver of fast bar rotation rates.
#### Radiation hydrodynamic simulation of the Haro 11 galaxy: the escape of LyC and Ly$α$ in a dwarf galaxy merger

 - **Abstract**
 The Haro 11 galaxy merger is the closest known Lyman Continuum (LyC) leaker and a strong Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) emitter, making it an important analogue of the high-$z$ galaxies that reionised the early Universe. To investigate how Haro 11's properties arise, we perform a radiation hydrodynamics simulation of the merger, and create mock observations of LyC, Ly$\alpha$, and H$\alpha$, from which we compute their luminosities ($L$) and escape fractions ($f_{\rm esc}$). We track these quantities along multiple sightlines as the two progenitor galaxies merge, from the first interaction until the system resembles present-day Haro 11. We find that $L$ and $f_{\rm esc}$ vary by 1-2 orders of magnitude for LyC due to sightline variations. At the two pericentre passages, the total $f_{\rm esc}^{\rm LyC}$ increases by roughly an order of magnitude. Conversely, $f_{\rm esc}^{\rm Ly\alpha}$ shows a moderate increase at the pericentre passages, which affects the inference of LyC properties from Ly$\alpha$. We attribute this to a displacement of the LyC-emitting stars relative to the \Lya-emitting gas, combined with an increased density from gas compression. Furthermore, $f_{\rm esc}^{\rm LyC}$ is boosted during star formation bursts, likely due to stellar feedback. As direct comparison with Haro 11, the simulation qualitatively matches its morphology and luminosities. We find that among the dense stellar knots, knot C is the main contributor to both intrinsic and escaping LyC emission. Additionally, the Ly$\alpha$ spectra displays distinct features found in observations, implying similar gas conditions are present.
#### Tidal features as tracers of galaxy merger histories: the colours of tidal features in HSC-SSP

 - **Abstract**
 We measure the radial $g-i$ colour profiles of $\sim$32,000 galaxies drawn from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program optical imaging survey, including 1415 exhibiting tidal features. We compare the colour profiles of galaxies with and without tidal features to extract information about the properties of the mergers that created these features. We find negative colour gradients for both galaxies with and without tidal features and find that tidal feature-hosting red sequence galaxies have redder outskirts than their non-tidal feature hosting counterparts, consistent with the outskirts of these galaxies being dominated by stars accreted from gas-poor minor mergers. We find decreasing mass ratios of tidal features-to-host galaxy with increasing galaxy stellar mass, suggesting that less massive galaxies undergo mergers with companions closer in mass than more massive galaxies. Galaxies exhibiting streams have bluer outskirts than those hosting shells, and shells around red sequence galaxies tend to be more massive and have higher mass ratios to their hosts than streams, consistent with streams being formed from mergers with satellites less massive than those responsible for shells. The agreement between our findings and those of other observational and simulation-based works confirms the validity of our methodology and highlights the value of tidal features colours as a probe into the process through which galaxies evolve.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21231

 - **Abstract**
 We develop a machine learning model based on a structured variational autoencoder (VAE) framework to reconstruct and generate neutron star (NS) equations of state (EOS). The VAE consists of an encoder network that maps high-dimensional EOS data into a lower-dimensional latent space and a decoder network that reconstructs the full EOS from the latent representation. The latent space includes supervised NS observables derived from the training EOS data, as well as latent random variables corresponding to additional unspecified EOS features learned automatically. Sampling the latent space enables the generation of new, causal, and stable EOS models that satisfy astronomical constraints on the supervised NS observables, while allowing Bayesian inference of the EOS incorporating additional multimessenger data, including gravitational waves from LIGO/Virgo and mass and radius measurements of pulsars. Based on a VAE trained on a Skyrme EOS dataset, we find that a latent space with two supervised NS observables, the maximum mass $(M_{\max})$ and the canonical radius $(R_{1.4})$, together with one latent random variable controlling the EOS near the crust--core transition, can already reconstruct Skyrme EOSs with high fidelity, achieving mean absolute percentage errors of approximately $(0.15\%)$ for $(M_{\max})$ and $(R_{1.4})$ derived from the decoder-reconstructed EOS.
#### PERTURB-c: Correlation Aware Perturbation Explainability for Regression Techniques to Understand Retrieval Black-boxes

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper we introduce PERTURB-c, a correlation-aware framework for interpreting black box regression models with one-dimensional structured inputs. We demonstrate this framework on a simulated case study with machine learning based transit spectroscopy retrievals of exoplanet WASP-107b. Characterising many exoplanet atmospheres can answer important questions about planetary populations, but traditional retrievals are very resource intensive; machine learning based methods offer a fast alternative however (i) they require high volumes data (only obtainable through simulations) to train and (ii) their complexity renders them black-boxes. Better understanding how they reach predictions can allow us to inspect for biases, which is especially important with simulated data, and verify that predictions are made on the basis of physically plausible features. This ultimately improves the ease of adoption of machine learning techniques. The most used methods to explain machine learning model predictions (such as SHAP and other methods that rely on stochastic sample generation) suffer from high computational complexity and struggle to account for interactions between inputs. PERTURB-c addresses these issues by leveraging physical knowledge of the known spectral correlation. For visualisation of this analysis, we propose a heat-map-based representation which is better suited to large numbers of input features along a single dimension, and that is more intuitive to those who are already familiar with retrieval methods. Note that while we chose this exoplanet retrieval context to demonstrate our methodologies, the PERTURB-c framework is model agnostic and in a broader context has potential value across a plethora of adjacent regression problems.

 - **Abstract**
 Hot subdwarfs (hot sds) are compact, evolved stars near the Extreme Horizontal Branch (EHB) and are key to understanding stellar evolution and the ultraviolet excess in galaxies. We extend our previous analysis of Gaia XP spectra of hot subdwarf stars to a much larger sample, enabling a comprehensive study of their physical and binary properties. Our goal is to identify patterns in Gaia XP spectra, investigate binarity, and assess the influence of parameters such as temperature, helium abundance, and variability. We analyse approximately 20000 hot subdwarf candidates selected from the literature, combining Gaia XP data with published parameters. We apply Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) to the XP coefficients, which represent the Gaia XP spectra in a compact, feature-based form, to construct a similarity map. We then use self-organizing maps (SOMs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify spectra as binaries or singles, and as cool and helium-poor or hot and helium-rich. The spectra are normalised using asymmetric least squares baseline fitting to emphasise individual spectral features. The BP-RP colour dominates the similarity map, with additional influence from temperature, helium abundance, and variability. Most binaries, identified via the Virtual Observatory SED Analyser (VOSA), cluster in two filaments linked to main sequence companions. CNN classification suggests a strong correlation between variability and binarity, with binary fractions exceeding 60 percent for active hot subdwarfs. Gaia XP spectra combined with dimensionality reduction and machine learning effectively reveal patterns in hot subdwarf properties. Our findings indicate that binarity and environmental density strongly shape the evolutionary paths of hot subdwarfs, and we identify possible contamination by main sequence and cataclysmic variable stars in the base sample.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational lensing of gravitational wave (GW) will become the next frontier in studying cosmology and gravity. While time-delay cosmography using quadruply lensed GW events associated with optical images of the lens systems can provide precise measurement of the Hubble constant ($H_0$), they are considered to be much rarer than doubly lensed events. In this work, we analyze time-delay cosmography with doubly lensed GW events for the first time. We generate mock doubly lensed GW events with designed sensitivity of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) O5 network, with LIGO post-O5 upgrade, and with Einstein Telescope (ET) + Cosmic Explorer (CE) respectively, and select the events that can be associated with future galaxy surveys. Over 1000 realizations, we find an average of 0.2(2.4) qualified events with the LVK O5(post-O5) network. Whereas with the ET+CE network, we find an average of 73.2 qualified events over 100 realizations. Using the Singular Isothermal Sphere (SIS) lens model, we jointly estimate waveform parameters and the impact parameter with doubly lensed GW signals, and then forecast the constraints on cosmological parameters and modified GW propagation by combining time-delay cosmography and the standard siren approach. The average posterior gives a constraint on $H_0$ with a relative uncertainty of $14\%$, $10\%$ and $0.42\%$ in the $\Lambda$CDM model for the LVK O5, LVK post-O5, and ET+CE network, respectively. While the LVK network gives uninformative constraints on the $(w_0,w_a)$ dynamical dark energy model, the ET+CE network yields a moderate constraint of $w_0=-1.02^{+0.31}_{-0.22}$ and $w_a=0.48^{+0.99}_{-1.54}$. In addition, our method can provide precise constraints on modified GW propagation effects jointly with $H_0$.
