 - **Abstract**
 We present the splashback radius analysis of the Adaptive Matched Identifier of Clustered Objects (AMICO) galaxy cluster sample in the fourth data release of the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS). The sample contains 9049 rich galaxy clusters within $z\in[0.1,0.8]$, with shear measurements available for 8730 of them. We measure and model the stacked reduced shear, $g_{\rm t}$, and the cluster-galaxy correlation function, $w_{\rm cg}$, in bins of observed intrinsic richness, $\lambda^*$, and redshift, $z$. Building on the methods employed in recent cosmological analyses, we model the average splashback radius, $r_{\rm sp}$, of the underlying dark matter halo distribution, accounting for the known systematic uncertainties affecting measurements and theoretical models. By modelling $g_{\rm t}$ and $w_{\rm cg}$ separately, in the cluster-centric radial range $R\in[0.4,5]$ $h^{-1}$Mpc, we constrain $r_{\rm sp}$, the mass accretion rate, $\Gamma$, and the relation between $\mathcal{R}_{\rm sp}\equiv r_{\rm sp}/r_{200\rm m}$ and the peak height, $\nu_{200\rm m}$, over the mass range $M_{200\rm m}\in[0.4,20]$ $10^{14}h^{-1}$M$_\odot$. The two probes provide consistent results that also agree with $\Lambda$-cold dark matter model predictions. Our $\mathcal{R}_{\rm sp}$ constraints are consistent with those from previous observations. For $g_{\rm t}$ and $w_{\rm cg}$, we achieve a precision of 14% and 10% per cluster stack, respectively. The higher precision of $w_{\rm cg}$, enabled by its combination with weak-lensing constraints on the mass-richness relation, highlights the complementarity of lensing and clustering in measuring $r_{\rm sp}$ and constraining the properties of the infalling material region.
#### The stellar velocity anisotropy of strong lensing massive elliptical galaxies and its role in the inference of the Hubble parameter $H_0$ using spatially resolved kinematics

 - **Abstract**
 One of the biggest challenges in cosmology, the Hubble Tension, requires independent measurements of $H_0$, and strong lensing with time-delay cosmography is a promising avenue. The inclusion of spatially resolved kinematic data helps break the mass--sheet degeneracy, a key limitation in strong lensing. Kinematics, however, suffers from its own degeneracy due to unknown stellar velocity anisotropy, which can bias galaxy mass profile inferences. We investigate the bias in $H_0$ using a sample of ten massive elliptical galaxies at $z=0.2$ from the Illustris $TNG100$ simulations. We generate mock line-of-sight velocity-dispersion maps resembling JWST NIRSpec observations and test four anisotropy models: Osipkov--Merritt (OM), Mamon--Lokas (ML), constant $\beta$, and a generalized--OM (gOM) profile, under both kinematics-only and joint kinematics plus strong lensing analyses. We find a sub-percent average bias in $H_{0}$ across ten galaxies with joint modeling for three models: $+0.2 \pm 1.6\%$ (ML), $-0.9 \pm 1.9\%$ (constant) and $-0.9 \pm 1.6\%$ (gOM), with $\sim 5\%$ scatter. Joint modeling reduces bias, improves precision, and mitigates outlier results. Overall, the gOM model best recovers galaxy parameters and delivers the most accurate $H_{0}$ relative to posterior uncertainties considering both analyses. However, the single-parameter OM model produces large systematic biases: with kinematics only data, $H_{0}$ errors can exceed $20\%$, and even with joint modeling, produces an overall bias of $+11.5 \pm 1.3\%$ (OM). The higher bias in OM is unlikely to average out across an ensemble of galaxies. Our findings highlight the impact of anisotropy assumptions on $H_{0}$ inference and, more broadly, in galaxy dynamics.
#### Synchrotron Self-Compton Process for Constraining sub-GeV Dark Matter in Omega Centauri via SKA

 - **Abstract**
 The search for the particle identity of dark matter (DM) continues to be a primary objective in modern physics. In this field, the sub-GeV mass range of DM detection remains a crucial yet challenging window. We investigate synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission from electrons and positrons produced by MeV-scale DM annihilation as a novel indirect detection channel. Focusing on the globular cluster Omega Centauri and the sensitivity of the Square Kilometre Array, we derive constraints on the annihilation cross section reaching $\langle\sigma v\rangle \sim 10^{-30}\,\rm{cm}^{3}\,\rm{s}^{-1}$ in the tens-of-MeV range. Furthermore, constraints could even reach below $\langle\sigma v\rangle \sim 10^{-32}\,\rm{cm}^{3}\,\rm{s}^{-1}$ for extreme parameter choices. Remarkably, even under deliberately conservative astrophysical assumptions, this channel outperforms existing indirect limits, establishing SSC emission as a robust probe of sub-GeV DM.
