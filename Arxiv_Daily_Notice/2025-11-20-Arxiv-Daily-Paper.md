 - **Abstract**
 We introduce J-HERTz (J-PLUS Heritage Exploration of Radio Targets at $z < 5$), a new multi-wavelength catalog that combines optical narrow-band photometry from J-PLUS, infrared observations from WISE, and deep low-frequency radio data from LoTSS for nearly half a million sources across 2,100 deg$^2$ of the northern sky. Key innovations of J-HERTz include Bayesian neural network classifications for 390,000 galaxies, 31,000 quasars, and 20,000 stars, along with significantly improved photometric redshifts for 235,000 galaxies compared to previous J-PLUS DR3 and LoTSS DR2 estimates. We identify 831 candidate Galactic radio stars, which, if confirmed, would constitute a significant addition to the number of radio-emitting stars identified to date. Among radio-loud galaxies with spectroscopic observations, $\gtrsim$20% lack Seyfert or LINER signatures, indicating a substantial population of optically quiescent radio galaxies, in agreement with previous works. Spectral energy distribution fitting of their host galaxies using J-PLUS photospectra reveals systematically low specific star formation rates, consistent with quenched stellar populations. J-HERTz thus provides a powerful dataset to exploit radio-optical synergies, enabling studies that span from the origin of stellar radio emission to the AGN life cycle and the role of jet activity in shaping host galaxy evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration uses multiple independent search pipelines to detect gravitational waves, often resulting in multiple triggers (g-events) for a single astrophysical source. These triggers are grouped into superevents, raising a critical question for multimessenger astronomy: which g-event provides the most accurate sky localization for electromagnetic follow-up? Currently, the g-event with the highest signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is selected, under the assumption that it should provide the best estimators of the source's parameters, including its location on the sky. Analysis of simulated signals reveals systematic deviations from this expectation. In particular, a false-alarm rate (FAR)-based selector performs slightly better than the SNR-based method, but introduces pipeline biases. We present a neural network-based selector trained on simulated signals to identify the g-event with the minimum searched area -- a metric quantifying localization accuracy. The network uses information (detector SNRs, FAR, and chirp mass) from all of the triggers associated with each astrophysical source and is designed to be pipeline-agnostic. Our results show that the neural network outperforms both traditional selectors, achieving a mean searched area ~2% smaller than the SNR-based selector. Unlike FAR-based selection, the neural network preserves the underlying distribution of pipeline contributions, avoiding systematic biases toward specific pipelines. The network can be trained in approximately one minute on a few thousand events and performs event selection instantaneously, making it suitable for low-latency applications. These results demonstrate that machine learning can enhance multimessenger astronomy capabilities while maintaining fairness across detection pipelines. We recommend implementing this approach for future observing runs.

 - **Abstract**
 As we enter the era of large imaging surveys such as $\textit{Roman}$, Rubin, and $\textit{Euclid}$, a deeper understanding of potential biases and selection effects in optical astronomical catalogs created with the use of ML-based methods is paramount. This work focuses on a deeper understanding of the performance and limitations of deep learning-based classifiers as tools for galaxy merger identification. We train a ResNet18 model on mock Hubble Space Telescope CANDELS images from the IllustrisTNG50 simulation. Our focus is on a more challenging classification of galaxy mergers and nonmergers at higher redshifts $1<z<1.5$, including minor mergers and lower mass galaxies down to the stellar mass of $10^8 M_\odot$. We demonstrate, for the first time, that a deep learning model, such as the one developed in this work, can successfully identify even minor and low mass mergers even at these redshifts. Our model achieves overall accuracy, purity, and completeness of 73%. We show that some galaxy mergers can only be identified from certain observation angles, leading to a potential upper limit in overall accuracy. Using Grad-CAMs and UMAPs, we more deeply examine the performance and observe a visible gradient in the latent space with stellar mass and specific star formation rate, but no visible gradient with merger mass ratio or merger stage.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate spectral analysis of high-energy astrophysical sources often relies on comparing observed data to incident spectral models convolved with the instrument response. However, for Gamma-Ray Bursts and other high-energy transient events observed at high count rates, significant distortions (e.g., pile-up, dead time, and large signal trailing) are introduced, complicating this analysis. We present a method framework to address the model dependence problem, especially to solve the problem of energy spectrum distortion caused by instrument signal pile-up due to high counting rate and high-rate effects, applicable to X-ray, gamma-ray, and particle detectors. Our approach combines physics-based Monte Carlo (MC) simulations with a model-independent spectral inversion technique. The MC simulations quantify instrumental effects and enable correction of the distorted spectrum. Subsequently, the inversion step reconstructs the incident spectrum using an inverse response matrix approach, conceptually equivalent to deconvolving the detector response. The inversion employs a Convolutional Neural Network, selected for its numerical stability and effective handling of complex detector responses. Validation using simulations across diverse input spectra demonstrates high fidelity. Specifically, for 27 different parameter sets of the brightest gamma-ray bursts, goodness-of-fit tests confirm the reconstructed spectra are in excellent statistical agreement with the input spectra, and residuals are typically within $\pm 2\sigma$. This method enables precise analysis of intense transients and other high-flux events, overcoming limitations imposed by instrumental effects in traditional analyses.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an efficient estimator for higher-order galaxy clustering using small groups of nearby galaxies, or multiplets. Using the Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) sample from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2, we identify galaxy multiplets as discrete objects and measure their cross-correlations with the general galaxy field. Our results show that the multiplets exhibit stronger clustering bias as they trace more massive dark matter halos than individual galaxies. When comparing the observed clustering statistics with the mock catalogs generated from the N-body simulation AbacusSummit, we find that the mocks underpredict multiplet clustering despite reproducing the galaxy two-point auto-correlation reasonably well. This discrepancy indicates that the standard Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) model is insufficient to describe the properties of galaxy multiplets, revealing the greater constraining power of this higher-order statistic on galaxy-halo connection and the possibility that multiplets are specific to additional assembly bias. We demonstrate that incorporating secondary biases into the HOD model improves agreement with the observed multiplet statistics, specifically by allowing galaxies to preferentially occupy halos in denser environments. Our results highlight the potential of utilizing multiplet clustering, beyond traditional two-point correlation measurements, to break degeneracies in models describing the galaxy-dark matter connection.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the cosmological dynamics of a universe described by Lyra's geometry in the presence of dark energy (DE) and dark matter (DM). Dark energy is modeled as a quintessence scalar field with bulk viscosity, while dark matter is allowed to interact with the scalar sector. The displacement vector field, arising naturally in Lyra's manifold, provides an additional geometric contribution. By employing dynamical system techniques, we analyze stability properties and late-time attractors. Our results indicate that viscosity and DE--DM interaction enrich the phase space structure and can help address both the cosmic acceleration and the coincidence problem. Furthermore, by performing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis with recent observational datasets, we derive best-fit values for the model parameters that exhibit good consistency with current data.

 - **Abstract**
 The $21\,$cm signal originating from Cosmic Dawn to the Epoch of Reionisation is highly sensitive to the processes governing star formation in the early universe as well as new physics. In this work, we focus on the imprint of non-cold dark matter (DM), which impacts the formation of the smallest halos. Our goal in particular is to clarify whether near-future radio telescopes such as the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionisation Array (HERA), will be able to distinguish between free-streaming dark matter, specifically in the form of thermal warm DM (WDM), and collisional damping due to neutrino-DM ($\nu$DM) interactions giving rise to larger overdensities on small scales. For that purpose we first implement a mapping between the two models in terms of a cutoff scale and determine detection thresholds for the two DM models. Using Fisher matrix forecasts, we show that $\nu$DM interaction strengths down to $\sigma_{\nu{\rm DM}}\sim 3\times10^{-35}$ cm$^2$ could be probed by $21\,$cm cosmology when considering two populations of galaxies for a GeV mass DM. This would allow to either confirm or rule out a recent claimed preference for a non-zero $\nu$DM interaction in Lyman-$\alpha$ data. Furthermore, we find that HERA will not be able to distinguish between $\nu$DM and WDM. In the latter context, the threshold for detection of $\nu$DM interactions translates into WDM with mass up to $m_{\rm WDM}\sim 9$ keV that could be detected by HERA.

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are challenging to identify due to their transient nature, complex temporal profiles, and limited observational datasets. We address this with a one-dimensional convolutional neural network integrated with an Adaptive Frequency Feature Enhancement module and physics-informed data augmentation. Our framework generates 100,000 synthetic GRB samples, expanding training data diversity and volume while preserving physical fidelity-especially for low-significance events. The model achieves 97.46% classification accuracy, outperforming all tested variants with conventional enhancement modules, highlighting enhanced domain-specific feature capture. Feature visualization shows model focuses on deep-seated morphological features and confirms the capability of extracting physically meaningful burst characteristics. Dimensionality reduction and clustering reveal GRBs with similar morphologies or progenitor origins cluster in the feature space, linking learned features to physical properties. This perhaps offers a novel diagnostic tool for identifying kilonova- and supernova-associated GRB candidates, establishing criteria to enhance multi-messenger early-warning systems. The framework aids current time-domain surveys, generalizes to other rare transients, and advances automated detection in large-volume observational data.

 - **Abstract**
 Blind source separation (BSS) plays a pivotal role in modern astrophysics by enabling the extraction of scientifically meaningful signals from multi-frequency observations. Traditional BSS methods, such as those relying on fixed wavelet dictionaries, enforce sparsity during component separation, but may fall short when faced with the inherent complexity of real astrophysical signals. In this work, we introduce the Learnlet Component Separator (LCS), a novel BSS framework that bridges classical sparsity-based techniques with modern deep learning. LCS utilizes the Learnlet transform: a structured convolutional neural network designed to serve as a learned, wavelet-like multiscale representation. This hybrid design preserves the interpretability and sparsity, promoting properties of wavelets while gaining the adaptability and expressiveness of learned models. The LCS algorithm integrates this learned sparse representation into an iterative source separation process, enabling effective decomposition of multi-channel observations. While conceptually inspired by sparse BSS methods, LCS introduces a learned representation layer that significantly departs from classical fixed-basis assumptions. We evaluate LCS on both synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating superior separation performance compared to state-of-the-art methods (average gain of about 5 dB on toy model examples). Our results highlight the potential of hybrid approaches that combine signal processing priors with deep learning to address the challenges of next-generation cosmological experiments.
#### The VVVX quest for satellites around the Circinus galaxy

 - **Abstract**
 The Circinus galaxy is the nearest type-2 Seyfert galaxy, which is at a distance of 4.2 Mpc. Its environment is challenging to explore because it is located at low Galactic latitudes, behind the Galactic disc. The long-term goal is to characterise the Circinus galaxy halo and determine the presence of dwarf satellites using near-infrared data. We selected 1,542 galaxies from the VVV NIRGC within a 2-degree radius around Circinus, representing 2/3 of the virial radius. Structural parameters such as half-light radii and colours were used, and correlations were examined. A neural network was trained with 486 galaxies with known spectroscopic redshifts to estimate photometric redshifts for all galaxies. Potential satellites were defined based on half-light radii compatible with the typical sizes of dwarf satellites, and combined with photometric redshifts. The galaxy properties are reliably characterised down to $K_{s}$ $\sim$ 15.5 mag, which represents about 90% completeness of detections. At the distance of Circinus, this limiting magnitude corresponds to $K_{s}$ absolute magnitude of $-12.6$ mag, which allows us to find dwarf galaxies. There are 20 galaxies with half-light radii larger than 2.45 arcsec, only 8 have photometric redshifts below 0.04. None of these galaxies is close to Circinus, which has a redshift of 0.0015. The ANNz model exhibited a high degree of accuracy in the range $0.001 < z_{phot} < 0.023$. The presence of dwarf satellites could not be confirmed with the available data in the studied region. The apparent lack of satellites may be genuine, possibly related to AGN feedback effects. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of combining near-infrared data and machine learning techniques to estimate photometric redshifts at low Galactic latitudes, providing useful information for future spectroscopic follow-up campaigns.
