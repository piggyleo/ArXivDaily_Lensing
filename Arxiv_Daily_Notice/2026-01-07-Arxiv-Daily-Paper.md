 - **Abstract**
 A model one-dimensional self consistent steady state collisionless self-gravitating system in which all the particles have the same energy is presented. This has the remarkable property that the position and velocity of the particles orbiting in their own self consistent potential are given exactly, in terms of time, by the truncations of sine and cosine functions to the first two terms in their respective Taylor series. The potential and density also have simple analytic expressions in terms of time as parameter. It is not being claimed that this system has any direct astronomical application. However, it does motivate a conjecture about the behaviour of the density, potential, and orbits near caustics in simulations of cold collisionless dark matter. It is a rather surprising result which might interest practitioners of stellar dynamics and serve as an elementary example in teaching the subject.
#### Cosmic Collider Gravitational Waves sourced by Right-handed Neutrino production from Bubbles: Testing Seesaw, Leptogenesis and Dark Matter

 - **Abstract**
 We study a minimal type-I seesaw framework in which a first-order phase transition (FOPT), driven by a singlet scalar, produces right-handed neutrinos (RHNs) through bubble collisions, realizing a cosmic-scale collider that probes ultra-high energy scales. The resulting RHN distribution sources novel low-frequency gravitational-waves (GWs) in addition to the standard bubble-collision contribution. A stable lightest RHN can account for the observed dark matter (DM) relic abundance for masses as low as $M_{1} \equiv m_{\rm DM} \gtrsim 10^{6}\,\mathrm{GeV}$, with the associated novel GW signal accessible in LISA, ET and upcoming LVK detectors. If the RHNs are unstable, their CP-violating decays generate the observed baryon asymmetry via leptogenesis for $M_{1} \gtrsim 10^{11}\,\mathrm{GeV}$ and phase transition temperatures $T_* \gtrsim 10^{6}\,\mathrm{GeV}$, for which the novel GW spectrum is detectable in ET, BBO and upcoming LVK. If RHN decays also populate a dark-sector fermion with mass $m_{\chi} \in [10^{-4},10^{4}],\mathrm{GeV}$, successful co-genesis of baryons and asymmetric dark matter occurs for $T_* \gtrsim 10^{7}\,\mathrm{GeV}$ and $M_{1} \gtrsim 10^{9}\,\mathrm{GeV}$, naturally explaining $\Omega_{\rm DM} \simeq 5\Omega_{\rm B}$. The corresponding GW signals are testable with LISA, ET, and BBO. Finally, we analyze a UV-complete multi-Majoron model, based on a global $U(1)_N \times U(1)_{\rm B-L}$ extension, motivated from the hierarchy of lepton masses, which we dub as Mojaron collider. The corresponding FOPT in this model leaves a distinctive GW signature arising from RHN production during $U(1)_N$ symmetry breaking detectable by BBO, ET and upcoming LVK. Successful leptogenesis is realized for heaviest RHN mass $M_3 \sim 10^{10}\,\mathrm{GeV}$ and a $U(1)_N$ breaking vev $v_2 \sim \mathcal{O}(\mathrm{TeV})$, which sets the seesaw scale.
#### Optomechanical platform for high-frequency gravitational wave and vector dark matter detection

 - **Abstract**
 We present a proposal for a nanomechanical membrane resonator integrated into a moderate-finesse ($\mathcal{F}\sim 10$) optical cavity as a versatile platform for detecting high-frequency gravitational waves and vector dark matter. Gravitational-wave sensitivity arises from cavity-length modulation, which resonantly drives membrane motion via the radiation-pressure force. This force also enables in situ tuning of the membrane's resonance frequency by nearly a factor of two, allowing a frequency coverage from 0.5 to 40 kHz using six membranes. The detector achieves a peak strain sensitivity of $2\times 10^{-23}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ at 40 kHz. Using a silicon membrane positioned near a gallium-arsenide input mirror additionally provides sensitivity to vector dark matter via differential acceleration from their differing atomic-to-mass number ratios. The projected reach surpasses the existing limits in the range of $2\times 10^{-12}$ to $2\times 10^{-10}$ $\text{eV}/c^2$ for a one-year measurement. Consequently, the proposed detector offers a unified approach to searching for physics beyond the Standard Model, probing both high-frequency gravitational waves and vector dark matter.

 - **Abstract**
 Polar-structure galaxies (PSGs) host photometrically and kinematically decoupled components oriented at large angles to one another. These systems, which include polar rings, polar disks, polar halos, polar bulges, polar dust lanes, and polar tidal structures, provide valuable insights into galaxy formation and evolution, although their rarity has limited statistical studies. We aim to construct the largest and most homogeneous catalog of PSGs to date in order to enable robust statistical studies of their properties and occurrence rates in the local Universe. Using DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys (DR10) data, we identified PSG candidates in the Siena Galaxy Atlas (SGA) through visual inspection, convolutional neural network classification, and cross-matching with previously reported systems. Each galaxy was assigned a PSG subtype and host morphology. We analyzed general properties of PSGs and compared them with those for all galaxies in the SGA. Simple image simulations were used to evaluate projection effects. The resulting Catalog of Unusual Galaxies with polar Structures in the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys (COUGS-DESI) contains 2,989 PSG candidates, including 342 previously known objects. Projection effects from random galaxy overlaps are negligible. The sample spans a wide range of polar morphologies, with 1,113 polar rings, 75 polar bulges, 216 polar halos, 185 polar dust lanes, and 1,315 polar tidal structures. PSGs constitute 2.2% of local non-dwarf galaxies, with polar rings representing 0.7%. Approximately 1% of S0 galaxies in the SGA host polar rings, whereas spirals constitute the most common morphological type among the PSG hosts in our catalog. COUGS--DESI increases the number of known PSG candidates by an order of magnitude and provides a foundation for detailed studies of the formation and evolution of polar structures.
#### Indications of a Late-Time Transition to a Strongly Interacting Dark Sector

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the transition from the $\Lambda$CDM to an interacting dark sector by introducing a model with a redshift threshold that controls the onset of the energy transfer between the dark energy and the dark matter. Below the transition redshift, the interaction between dark matter and dark energy becomes active, while at earlier times the cosmological evolution coincides with that of $\Lambda$CDM. This approach allows us to determine the epoch in the comic history where the interacting effects have an impact in the description of the dark sector. We constrain the free parameters of the model using late-time cosmological observations, namely Cosmic Chronometers, DESI DR2 Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations, and Supernova data from the Pantheon Plus, Union3.0, and DES-Dovekie catalogues. The analysis provides an indication of a strong interacting term that describes energy transfer from dark energy to dark matter, which is activated at low redshifts. The PantheonPlus sample provides a threshold of $z_{T}<0.624$, the Union3.0 sample yields $z_{T}=0.400_{-0.23}^{+0.021}$, and the DES-Dovekie sample gives $z_{T}=0.371_{-0.26}^{+0.028}$. The model fits the data in a similar way to the CPL parametrization, without the dark energy to cross the phantom divide line.

 - **Abstract**
 We present photometric properties of 161 galaxy candidates at $z=7-14$ selected from the second data release (DR2) of BEACON, a JWST Cycle 2 pure-parallel NIRCam imaging program. Carefully selected from 36 independent pointings (corresponding to $\sim350$\,arcmin$^2$ sky coverage), and hence with reduced cosmic variance, our galaxy candidates provide an unbiased sample for investigating galaxy properties over a wide range of environments. We measure the physical properties, including UV continuum slope ($\beta_{\rm UV}$), stellar mass ($M_*$), star formation rate (SFR), and sizes. Our highest redshift galaxy candidate at $z=13.71\pm0.15$ has a remarkably bright UV luminosity of $M_{\rm UV}=-21.19\pm0.08$, making it the brightest galaxy at $z>12$ if spectroscopically confirmed. With an extremely blue UV slope, compact morphology, and high star formation rate surface density ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$), this candidate may have extremely low metallicity, high ionizing photon escape fraction, or contributions from an AGN. Among our multiple independent sightlines, we identify three fields of galaxy number overdensity with $>3\sigma$ significance. The properties of galaxies in various environments do not exhibit significant differences, implying either that accelerated galaxy evolution in overdense regions is not yet widespread at $z>7$, or that the current constraints are limited by sample size. Our simulations indicate that increasing the sample by an order of magnitude would allow such environmental trends to be robustly confirmed or ruled out, underscoring the importance of future pure-parallel observations.
#### Late-time Background Constraints on Linear and Non-linear Interacting Dark Energy after DESI DR2

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we present observational constraints on a class of phenomenological interacting dark energy (IDE) models that admit analytical solutions for the Hubble parameter $H(z)$. We consider a set of five linear and three non-linear IDE scenarios, encompassing both interactions proportional to the dark matter and/or dark energy densities, as well as non-linear combinations of the two. For all eight IDE models, we find a better fit than $\Lambda$CDM from a $\Delta\chi^2$ analysis for both combinations of datasets considered. When using the Akaike Information Criterion ($\Delta$AIC), we find a similarly improved fit in all cases, except for one dataset combination in $Q=3H\delta\rho_{\rm de}$. Our analysis also shows a preference for sign-switching interactions, with energy transfer from dark energy to dark matter at low redshift, reversing direction at higher redshift. These results should be interpreted with caution, as the latter direction of energy transfer is accompanied by negative dark energy densities in the past, which may be unphysical. Models that do not allow sign-changing behaviour instead show a preference for energy flow from dark matter to dark energy, and hence negative dark energy densities. The only exceptions are $Q=3H\delta\rho_{\rm de}$ and $Q=3H\delta\left(\tfrac{\rho_{\rm de}^2}{\rho_{\rm dm}+\rho_{\rm de}}\right)$, which exhibit energy flow in the opposite direction. Furthermore, for all interactions considered, we find a phantom-divide crossing in the effective dark energy equation of state $w^{\rm eff}_{\rm de}$, with the dark energy density decreasing ($w^{\rm eff}_{\rm de}>-1$) at present and at low redshift, while increasing ($w^{\rm eff}_{\rm de}<-1$) in the past at high redshift. These results highlight the promising, but problematic, nature of dark sector interactions, as well as the need to extend the analysis using early-time physics and datasets.
