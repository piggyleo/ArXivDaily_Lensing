#### A search for cold molecular outflows in cosmic noon galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 The flow of baryons in and out of galaxies is the primary driver for galaxy evolution. In addition to depleting the gas reservoir of galaxies, outflows also enrich their circumgalactic medium (CGM) with processed gas -- which can further impact the next stages of gas accretion, resulting in the presence of molecular gas beyond the stellar component of galaxies, out to CGM scales. Here, we aim to search for cold molecular gas (MH2) in the CGM of typical main-sequence (MS) star-forming galaxies (SFGs) at cosmic noon (zmed=1.3), where we expect outflows to be particularly prominent. Using Band 3 CO(2-1) data from the Atacama Large Millimeter and submillimeter Array (ALMA), we study the spatial extent of the MH2 of a sample of 26 SFGs, via stacking techniques. We compare this extent to that of the stacked stellar emission of our sample traced by UltraVISTA Ks band data. We also search for broad wings in the stacked spectrum which can be indicative of ongoing outflows. Within the noise level of the observations, we find that the total intrinsic MH2 of our sample spatially extends to scales of ~12 kpc, similarly to the stellar emission (~13 kpc). We do not find broad wings in the stacked spectrum that could hint at ongoing molecular outflows, but we find a tentative minor excess of CO(2-1) emission at negative velocities that might be indicative of outflows, where the redshifted gas is optically thick. The absence of high-velocity molecular gas suggests that molecular outflows traced by CO(2-1) emission are weak in MS SFGs at cosmic noon. These weak outflows thus fail to expel a significant amount of molecular gas to CGM scales, as indicated by the absence of molecular emission extending beyond the stellar emission region. This lack of CO emission at large radii could also imply that the molecular gas does not survive at such distances.

 - **Abstract**
 Data from ground-based gravitational wave detectors are often contaminated by non-Gaussian instrumental artifacts or detector noise transients. Unbiased source property estimation relies on the ability to correctly identify and characterize these artifacts and remove them if necessary. To this end, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration has implemented candidate vetting for all significant candidates to identify the presence of artifacts and assess the need for mitigation. The current candidate vetting process requires human experts to identify the frequency ranges and the time windows associated with any data quality issues present. Differences in judgment between human experts may cause inconsistency, making results difficult to reproduce across gravitational wave events. We present GSpyNetTreeS, an extension to GSpyNetTree based on the You Only Look Once algorithm, for the automatic detection, classification, and time-frequency localization of detector noise transients. As a proof of concept, we tested GSpyNetTreeS's performance on the data collected by the LIGO detectors during the third observing run for gravitational waves as well as common detector glitch classes included in GSpyNetTree: Blip, Low frequency blip, Low frequency line and Scratchy. We also demonstrated that GSpyNetTreeS is capable of accurately identifying common glitch classes and capturing the frequency and time information associated with detected detector noise transients, establishing its potential as an automatic event validation tool for LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's observing runs.
#### Comparing galaxy merger orbits in hydrodynamical simulation and in dark-matter-only simulation

 - **Abstract**
 To investigate how the presence of baryons in simulations affects galaxy merger orbits, we compare in detail the merger timescales and orbits of the matched merger pairs in TNG100 hydrodynamical simulations and their corresponding dark-matter-only simulations, for different resolution levels. Compared with the mergers in the TNG100-1-Dark simulation without baryons, the matched mergers in the TNG100-1 simulation have similar infall time, but have statistically earlier merger times and therefore shorter merger timescales. The merger orbits for the matched pairs in the TNG100-1 and the TNG100-1-Dark simulations are similar right after infall, and both evolve to more head-on orbits at final stages, with smaller changes in the hydrodynamical simulation. In the final 2 Gyr before merger, the collision angles that represent merger orbits quantitatively are smaller in TNG100-1 than those in TNG100-1-Dark, by around 6$^\circ$ to 10$^\circ$, depending on the mass ratios and galaxy masses investigated. Our results demonstrate that the presence of baryons accelerates a bit the merger processes, and results in more spiral-in orbits for both major and minor mergers in galaxies with various stellar masses. These effects are less obvious in simulations with lower resolutions.
#### Morphological Image Similarity Search on the ALMA Science Archive Query Interface Using Deep Unsupervised Contrastive Representation Learning

 - **Abstract**
 With the exponential growth of astronomical data over time, finding the needles in the haystack is becoming increasingly difficult. The next frontier for science archives is to enable searches not only on observational metadata, but also on the content of the observations themselves. As a step in this direction, we have implemented morphological image similarity search into the ALMA Science Archive (ASA). To achieve this we use self-supervised contrastive affine-transformation-independent representation learning of source morphologies with a deep neural network. For a given image on the ASA web interface, astronomers are presented with a summary view of the morphologically most similar images. Each time an astronomer selects an additional image from that view, the display is instantly updated to show the images most similar to the combination of the selected images. Each selection thus refines the similarity display according to the scientific needs of the astronomer. This is the first time image similarity search has been offered in an astronomical science archive.
#### RUBIX: Differentiable forward modelling of galaxy spectral data cubes for gradient-based parameter estimation

 - **Abstract**
 Although integral-field spectroscopy enables spatially resolved spectral studies of galaxies, bridging particle-based simulations to observations remains slow and non-differentiable. We present RUBIX, a JAX-based pipeline that models mock integral-field unit (IFU) cubes for galaxies end-to-end and calculates gradients with respect to particle inputs. Our implementation is purely functional, sharded, and differentiable throughout. We validate the gradients against central finite differences and demonstrate gradient-based parameter estimation on controlled setups. While current experiments are limited to basic test cases, they demonstrate the feasibility of differentiable forward modelling of IFU data. This paves the way for future work scaling up to realistic galaxy cubes and enabling machine learning workflows for IFU-based inference. The source code for the RUBIX software is publicly available under this https URL.
#### Dark Matter Admixed White Dwarfs: A Single-Fluid Approach

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17120

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we investigate the influence of an admixed fermionic dark matter (DM) component on the equilibrium structure of white dwarfs (WDs), with particular emphasis on the effects of varying the DM particle mass ($m_{\rm DM}$) and DM fraction ($f_{\rm DM}$). Notably, we employ a single-fluid approximation for the first time in this context, wherein the baryonic and DM contributions to the total energy density and pressure are treated within a unified framework, assuming non-interacting fermionic DM in hydrostatic equilibrium with baryons. We examine how variations in $m_{\mathrm{DM}}$ and $f_\mathrm{DM}$ modify the equation of state (EoS), the mass-radius relationship, and the internal mass and pressure distributions of WDs. Our results show that the presence of DM softens the EoS, with lighter DM particles providing stronger pressure support and leading to more extended stellar structures. Increasing the DM mass fraction leads to a more compact configuration, reducing both the radius and maximum mass of the WD. We further demonstrate that heavier DM particles enhance stellar compactness and can eventually drive the star toward gravitational instability. Moreover, the analysis of mass-radius relationships reveals that while small fractions of DM are consistent with observed WD masses, the radii predicted by our models are smaller than observations, suggesting additional influences such as rotation or magnetic fields. Our stability analysis confirms that the inclusion of dark matter does not lead to instability within the expected parameter space, indicating that white dwarfs admixed with dark matter can remain dynamically stable under certain conditions. These findings show that even a small admixture of DM can modify the structural properties and stability limits of WDs, providing a potential indirect astrophysical probe of DM particle properties.
#### Angular clustering and bias of photometric quasars in the Kilo-Degree Survey Data Release 4

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the angular clustering and effective bias of photometrically selected quasars in the Kilo-Degree Survey Data Release 4 (KiDS DR4). We update the previous photometric redshifts (photo-$z$s) of the KiDS quasars using Hybrid-z, a deep learning framework combining four-band KiDS images and nine-band KiDS+VIKING magnitudes. Hybrid-z is trained on the latest Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) DR1 and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR17 quasars matching with KiDS, and achieves average bias $\langle \delta z \rangle < 0.01$ and scatter $\sim 0.04(1 + z)$ on a test sample. The updated catalog of $\sim 157k$ quasars over $777~\mathrm{deg}^2$ is divided into four tomographic bins spanning $0.1 \leq z_{\mathrm{phot}} \leq 2.7$. In each bin, we measure the angular two-point correlation function and compare it with theoretical predictions for dark matter clustering. We estimate the best-fit scale-independent quasar bias, which increases from $b \approx 1.6$ at $z \approx 0.6$ to $b \approx 4.0$ at $z \approx 2.2$, and is well matched by a quadratic relation in redshift. Our clustering analysis indicates that KiDS quasars reside in dark matter halos of mass $\log_{10}(M_{\mathrm{eff}}/h^{-1}M_\odot)$ in the range $\sim 12.7$--$12.9$ and effective peak heights $\nu_{\mathrm{eff}}$ rising from $\sim 1.5$ to $2.9$ over our redshift span. We study two systematics that could affect the bias derivation: stellar contamination and the redshift distribution assumed in the theoretical modeling. The former has a negligible effect, whereas the latter significantly impacts the derived $b(z)$, emphasizing the importance of redshift calibration. Our work is the first cosmological application of quasars selected from KiDS and paves the way for future extensions in the final KiDS DR5, the Legacy Survey of Space and Time, or the 4-metre Multi-Object Spectroscopic Telescope.
#### Deep Learning Analysis of Ions Accelerated at Shocks

 - **Abstract**
 We study the application of deep learning techniques to the analysis and classification of ions accelerated at collisionless shocks in hybrid (kinetic ions--fluid electrons) simulations. Ions were classified as thermal, suprathermal, or nonthermal, depending on the energy they achieved and the acceleration regime they fell under. These classifications were used to train deep learning models to predict which particles are injected into the acceleration process with high accuracy (>90%), using only time series of the local magnetic field they experienced during their initial interaction with the shock. An autoencoder architecture was also tested, for which time series of various parameters were reconstructed from encoded representations. This study shows the potential of applying machine learning techniques to extract physical insights from kinetic plasma simulations and sets the groundwork for future applications, including the construction of sub-grid models in fluid approaches.
