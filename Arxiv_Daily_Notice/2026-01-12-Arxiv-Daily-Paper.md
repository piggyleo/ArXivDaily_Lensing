 - **Abstract**
 The observational tension regarding the value of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) has motivated the exploration of alternative cosmological scenarios, including Interacting Dark Energy models. However, the majority of IDE models studied in the literature rely on phenomenological interaction terms proportional to the Hubble parameter (e.g., $Q\propto H\rho$), which lack a clear microphysical justification and often suffer from large-scale instabilities. In this work, we propose and investigate a "bottom-up" IDE model where the interaction is formulated directly from particle physics collision processes, taking the form $Q\propto\rho^2$. This interaction represents a reversible annihilation/creation process between Dark Matter and Dark Energy, motivated by the Boltzmann equation. We test this model against a combination of background cosmological data, Pantheon Plus, Cosmic Chronometers, DESI DR2, and CMB distance priors from Planck18. We find that the model is consistent with the data, yielding a Hubble constant of $H_0=67.71\pm0.65$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ for the combined analysis. The dimensionless interaction rate coefficients are constrained to be small, with upper limits of $A < 7.586\times10^{-25}$ (for Dark Matter self annihilation) and $B < 0.048$ (for Dark Energy self annihilation) at 95\% confidence level. Since the interaction model is parameterized by the expansion rate, these bounds on $H_0$, $A$, and $B$ directly translate into a strict limit on the thermally-averaged annihilation cross-section per unit of mass. The constraints on the coupling $A$ imply that, if such a collisional interaction exists, the effective dark-matter annihilation cross section per unit mass is highly suppressed relative to the cosmological expansion rate. In contrast, the corresponding dark-energy contribution, governed by $B$, is only constrained at the level of a few percent in dimensionless units.
#### Extragalactic archaeology through high-resolution integrated-light spectroscopy of globular clusters

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05849

 - **Abstract**
 We propose to radically expand the use of extragalactic globular clusters as tools for extragalactic archaeology. We propose a large-scale spectroscopic facility to obtain high spectral resolution (R $\sim$ 20,000) spectroscopy for a significant fraction of all globular clusters in the nearby Universe. This will facilitate the reconstruction of galaxy assembly histories via chemical tagging, trace dark matter haloes, and measure extragalactic distances.
#### Ultra Diffuse Galaxies in clusters : the peculiar gas loss of VCC 1964
 - **Authors:** Rhys Taylor, Vojtech Partík, Robert Minchin

Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05948

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.05948

 - **Abstract**
 Context : Ultra Diffuse Galaxies are low surface brightness systems which have been detected in HI in the field, where their line widths sometimes indicate significant dark matter deficits. They are rarely detected in HI in clusters, making their dynamical properties difficult to assess. The relation between field and cluster populations is unclear. Aims : Detecting UDGs entering a cluster could give important clues to their evolution, both in terms of their dynamics but also as to whether they are structurally similar - i.e. if cluster UDGs are generally the same as field UDGs except with less gas and an older stellar population. Methods : We use data from two deep Arecibo surveys, the Arecibo Galaxy Environment Survey and the Widefield Arecibo Virgo Environment Survey, to measure the gas content of the UDG-candidate VCC 1964. Optical properties are quantified from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and DESI Legacy Surveys. Results : We find a significant 9 kpc offset between the HI and optical components of VCC 1964, no evidence of asymmetry in the HI, and only a modest deficiency level. This suggests a wholesale displacement of the gas content. The line width is 4-5 sigma deviant from the baryonic and over 6 sigma deviant from the optical forms of the Tully-Fisher relation. The optical component is blue and smooth. Conclusions : VCC 1964 is consistent with a UDG experiencing gas displacement due to ram pressure as it enters the cluster for the first time. Intriguingly, its dynamics imply a significant dark matter deficit, however we cannot rule out that this may be due to the gas being displaced out of equilibrium.
#### Feasibility of event-by-event primary mass discrimination using radio observables and supervised machine learning

High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05969

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.05969

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we investigate the feasibility of event-by-event primary mass discrimination using radio observables only. Although the analysis does not require an explicit reconstruction of the shower maximum ($X_{max}$), the discrimination power still arises from the sensitivity of the radio observables to the longitudinal development of the extensive air shower (EAS). Such radio-based approaches could be particularly relevant for radio-only experiments, such as GRAND. To assess this feasibility, we obtained conservative upper limits for the discrimination accuracy using a supervised machine-learning (ML) algorithm, namely a random forest (RF). The input features used were the peak electric fields and the spectral slopes, which have complementary discrimination power, along with the antenna distances to the shower axis. The RF was trained and tested using large event sets generated by the fast radio emission simulation and simplified detector response implemented in the RDSim framework. We obtained discrimination accuracies between 81\% and 96\% over the studied zenith range, even after normalizing each shower by its own electromagnetic energy. Since the analysis includes deliberately conservative choices, such as a large 10\% uncertainty on the reconstructed EM energy, these quoted values should be interpreted as conservative upper limits suitable for a feasibility assessment. Our results demonstrate that event-by-event primary mass discrimination using radio observables is, in principle, feasible.
#### An Improved UV-Optical Diagnostic for Rejuvenating Galaxies in the Local Universe and Implications for Galaxy Evolution

 - **Abstract**
 Rejuvenating galaxies are important probes of galaxy evolution, yet identifying them observationally is challenging as constraining recent star formation histories requires both photometric and spectroscopic data. We present a method for identifying rejuvenating galaxies in the local Universe using ultraviolet (UV) imaging and optical spectroscopy, building on a recent selection that identifies a system as rejuvenating if it is quenched in the near-UV (NUV; tracing $\sim\!100\,\mathrm{Myr}$ timescales) but star-forming in H$\alpha$ (tracing $\sim\!10\,\mathrm{Myr}$ timescales). Shortly after a star formation episode, however, the NUV is dominated by the same massive stars that power H$\alpha$, so these indicators do not always trace distinct timescales. To address this, we derive a relation that predicts the NUV emission associated with the ionizing O-star population traced by H$\alpha$, enabling us to isolate the NUV contribution from longer-lived stars (primarily B/A stars with $M\lesssim\!20\,M_\odot$). Subtracting the predicted O-star NUV from the dust-corrected NUV yields a more reliable rejuvenation diagnostic. Using this method, we identify $\sim\!10^{4}$ rejuvenating galaxies in a sample of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) galaxies ($\sim\!4.5\%$). These galaxies have intermediate stellar masses and are found primarily in lower-density environments, becoming increasingly rare toward the centers of groups and clusters. Rejuvenating galaxies also exhibit systematically lower gas-phase metallicities, consistent with fueling by the accretion of metal-poor gas.
#### Simulations of collision and sloshing in the galaxy group NGC 5098/5096

 - **Abstract**
 The study of galaxy groups is essential to understanding the evolutionary history of large-scale structures in the Universe. These dense environments have a significant impact on galaxy evolution, influencing their gas content, morphology, and star formation activity. In this work we analyse in detail the system NGC~5098$/$5096 composed of two galaxy groups. We performed hydrodynamical $N$-body simulations of a galaxy group collision aimed at reproducing the gas sloshing and surface brightness distribution observed in X-ray data. We conducted a detailed X-ray analysis and generated mock image \textit{Chandra} observations from our simulations. The resulting corrected mock image surface brightness profiles show good agreement with the observed data. The relative line-of-sight velocity between NGC~5098 and NGC~5096 is $v_{\mathrm{los}} = 700$ km s$^{-1}$, with a projected separation of $d_{\mathrm{proj}} = 155$ kpc, suggesting that the collision occurs nearly in the line-of-sight. Our simulations were performed with an inclination angle of $80^\circ$ in order to reproduce the dynamical constraints. We also find a correlation between the dark matter and intragroup light distributions when comparing the residual dark matter map with the intragroup light morphology. Our best-fitting model is consistent with these observational constraints and provides a plausible dynamical scenario for the current state of the NGC~5098 group interaction with NGC 5096.
