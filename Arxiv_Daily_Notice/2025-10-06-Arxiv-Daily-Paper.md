 - **Abstract**
 The caustic skeleton model is a mathematically rigorous framework for studying the formation history of the emerging cosmic web from the caustics in the underlying dark matter flow. In a series of two papers, we use constrained N-body simulations to investigate the different cosmic web environments. For the current study, we focus on the cosmic walls. We derive the conditions of the centres of proto-walls and analyse their evolution with N-body simulations. Next, we investigate the statistical properties of Zel'dovich pancakes by studying the number density of the cosmic wall centres in scale space and, for the first time, we calculate the Lagrangian-space volume of cosmic walls. Finally, we infer the mean density and velocity fields and the distribution of haloes around cosmic walls with a suite of physically realistic dark-matter-only simulations. We compare the cosmic walls obtained with the caustic skeleton framework with previously proposed saddle point conditions on the primordial potential and density perturbation.
#### No Observational Evidence for Dark Matter Nor a Large Metallicity Spread in the Extreme Milky Way Satellite Ursa Major III / UNIONS 1

 - **Abstract**
 The extremely-low-luminosity, compact Milky Way satellite Ursa Major III / UNIONS 1 (UMaIII/U1; $L_V = 11 \ L_{\odot}$; $a_{1/2} = 3$ pc) was found to have a substantial velocity dispersion at the time of its discovery ($\sigma_v = 3.7^{+1.4}_{-1.0} \rm \ km \ s^{-1}$), suggesting that it might be an exceptional, highly dark-matter-dominated dwarf galaxy with very few stars. However, significant questions remained about the system's dark matter content and nature as a dwarf galaxy due to the small member sample ($N=11$), possible spectroscopic binaries, and the lack of any metallicity information. Here, we present new spectroscopic observations covering $N=16$ members that both dynamically and chemically test UMaIII/U1's true nature. From higher-precision Keck/DEIMOS spectra, we find a 95% confidence level velocity dispersion limit of $\sigma_v< 2.3 \rm \ km \ s^{-1}$, with a $\sim$120:1 likelihood ratio now favoring the expected stellar-only dispersion of $\sigma_* \approx 0.1 \rm \ km \ s^{-1}$ over the original $3.7 \rm \ km \ s^{-1}$ dispersion. There is now no observational evidence for dark matter in the system. From Keck/LRIS spectra targeting the Calcium II K line, we also measure the first metallicities for 12 member stars, finding a mean metallicity of $\rm [Fe/H] = -2.65 \; \pm \, 0.1$ (stat.) $\pm \,0.3$ (zeropoint) with a metallicity dispersion limit of $\sigma_{\rm [Fe/H]} < 0.35$ dex (at the 95% credible level). Together, these properties are more consistent with UMaIII/U1 being a star cluster, though the dwarf galaxy scenario is not fully ruled out. Under this interpretation, UMaIII/U1 ranks among the most metal-poor star clusters yet discovered and is potentially the first known example of a cluster stabilized by a substantial population of unseen stellar remnants.
#### Accelerating cosmological simulations on GPUs: a portable approach using OpenMP

 - **Abstract**
 In this work we present the porting to Graphics Processing Units (GPUs, using OpenMP target directives) and optimization of a key module within the cosmological {\pinocchio} code, a Lagrangian Perturbation Theory (LPT)-based framework widely used for generating dark matter (DM) halo catalogs. Our optimization focuses on a specific segment of the code responsible for calculating the collapse time of each particle involved in the simulation. Due to the embarrassingly parallel nature of this computation, it represents an ideal candidate for GPU offloading. As part of the porting process, we developed fully GPU-native implementations of both cubic spline and bilinear interpolation routines, required for evaluating collapse times. Since GNU Scientific Library (GSL) does not support GPU offloading, these custom implementations run entirely on the GPU and achieve residuals of only $\sim0.003\%$ when compared to the CPU-based implementation of GSL. Comparative benchmarking on the LEONARDO (NVIDIA-based) and SETONIX (AMD-based) supercomputers reveals notable portability and performance, with speedups of~\textit{4x} and up to~\textit{8x}, respectively. While collapse time calculation is not a primary bottleneck in the overall workflow, the acceleration reduces full production runs by $\sim 100$ seconds each leading to a cumulative saving of $\sim 160000$ Standard-h ($\sim28$ hours wall time) across thousands of simulations. Roofline analysis confirms that our GPU porting achieves over 80\% of the theoretical FP64 peak performance, confirming efficient compute-bound execution. This work demonstrates that OpenMP directives offer a portable, effective strategy for accelerating large-scale cosmological simulations on heterogeneous hardware.
#### Focal-plane wavefront sensing with moderately broadband light using a short multi-mode fiber

Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03058

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.03058

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a focal-plane wavefront sensor (FPWFS) based on a short multimode fiber (MMF) capable of operating under moderately broadband illumination. By coupling the aberrated focal-plane field into an MMF of length <1 cm, we preserve modal interference over a 10 nm bandwidth at near-infrared wavelengths. The resulting output intensity pattern encodes pupil phase information, enabling wavefront recovery via a neural network. Our approach resolves the inherent sign ambiguity of even pupil-phase aberrations and operates on millisecond timescales using readily available computing hardware, suitable for real-time adaptive optics. Unlike traditional pupil-plane sensors, the proposed FPWFS shares the optical path with the science beam, eliminating non-common-path aberrations by enabling simultaneous wavefront and focal-plane intensity retrieval. Its simplicity, compactness, sensitivity, and low cost make it an attractive candidate for next-generation astronomical instruments.
#### On the origin of counterrotating stellar disks in TNG50. I

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding galaxy evolution is key to explaining the structures we observe in the present-day Universe. Counterrotating stellar disks (CRDs), i.e. co-spatial stellar disks rotating with opposite angular momentum, have been proposed as signatures of past accretion events. Therefore, they constitute potentially valuable tracers of galactic assembly. We aim to investigate the properties, formation, and significance of CRDs in a sample of Milky Way mass galaxies using the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulations. We select 260 central late-type galaxies (i.e. $M_{\rm tot} \approx 10^{12}$, $D/T>0.5$, $N_{\rm star}>10^5$). For each galaxy, we measure the circularity of its stellar particles and define the CRD by considering all particles with circularity $\epsilon < -0.7$, which are located within the spatial extension of the main disk. We then characterize the mass fraction, spatial extent, and star formation history of the CRDs. Out of the 260 galaxies, we find that 26 host significant CRDs (i.e. contributing at least 1\% of the total stellar mass of the disk). This means that CRDs are rare, consistent with the results from observations. We also find that the most of the CRDs are compact (i.e. 88\%), in-situ dominated (i.e.73\%), and exhibit bursty SFHs whose peaks often coincide with external perturbations. This means that external perturbations are able to catalyze star formation, even when a majority of the CRD's star population is in-situ. Finally, we find that a variety of formation pathways can lead to CRDs, including interaction-induced in-situ bursts and smooth accretion of misaligned gas. Overall, our results suggest that CRDs are rare but diverse in origin. In most cases, their formation is linked to the accretion of retrograde gas, either through mergers or environmental inflow, suggesting that these structures are sensitive tracers of the galaxy's past accretion history.
