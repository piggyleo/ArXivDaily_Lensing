 - **Abstract**
 Galactic warps are common in disk galaxies. While often attributed to galaxy--galaxy tides, a non-spherical dark matter (DM) halo has also been proposed as a driver of disk warping. We investigate links among warp morphology, satellite distribution, and large-scale structure using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey catalog of warped disks compiled by Zee et al.\ (2022). Warps are classified into 244 S and 127 U types, hosting 1,373 and 740 satellites, respectively, and are compared to an unwarped control matched in stellar mass, redshift, and local density. As an indirect, population-level proxy for the host halo's shape and orientation, we analyze the stacked spatial distribution of satellites. Warped hosts show a significant anisotropy: an excess at $45^{\circ}<\phi<90^{\circ}$ (measured from the host major axis), peaking at $P(\phi)\simeq 0.003$, versus nearly isotropic controls. Satellites of S-type warps preferentially align with the nearest cosmic filament, whereas those of U-type warps are more often perpendicular. The incidence of warps increases toward filaments ($r_{\rm fil}<4,{\rm Mpc},h^{-1}$), while the number of satellites around warped hosts remains approximately constant with filament distance, indicating a direct influence of the large-scale environment. We discuss possible links between galactic warps and the cosmic web, including anisotropic tidal fields and differences in evolutionary stage.

 - **Abstract**
 Machine learning enables powerful cosmological inference but typically requires many high-fidelity simulations covering many cosmological models. Transfer learning offers a way to reduce the simulation cost by reusing knowledge across models. We show that pre-training on the standard model of cosmology, $\Lambda$CDM, and fine-tuning on various beyond-$\Lambda$CDM scenarios -- including massive neutrinos, modified gravity, and primordial non-Gaussianities -- can enable inference with significantly fewer beyond-$\Lambda$CDM simulations. However, we also show that negative transfer can occur when strong physical degeneracies exist between $\Lambda$CDM and beyond-$\Lambda$CDM parameters. We consider various transfer architectures, finding that including bottleneck structures provides the best performance. Our findings illustrate the opportunities and pitfalls of foundation-model approaches in physics: pre-training can accelerate inference, but may also hinder learning new physics.
#### BaryonBridge: Stochastic Interpolant Model for Fast Hydrodynamical Simulations

 - **Abstract**
 Constructing a general-purpose framework for mapping between dark matter simulations and observable hydrodynamical simulation outputs is a long-standing problem in modern astrophysics. In this work, we present a new approach utilizing stochastic interpolants to map between cheap fast particle mesh simulations and baryonic quantities in three dimensions, requiring a total of 7 GPU minutes per 256^3 grid size simulation. Using the CAMELS multifield dataset, we are able to condition our mapping on both cosmological and astrophysical properties. We focus this work on hydrodynamical quantities suitable for Lya observables finding excellent agreement up to small spatial scales, k ~ 10.0 (h^(-1) Mpc) at z=2.0, for Lya flux statistics. Our approach is fully convolutional, allowing training on comparatively small volumes and application to larger volumes, which was tested on TNG50.
#### Application and development of advanced mathematical tools for population and time series analysis in pulsar astrophysics

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19434

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.19434

 - **Abstract**
 In this thesis, we introduce novel methods for analyzing pulsar populations using a variety of mathematical techniques. These tools-particularly graph theory-have been thoroughly validated in advanced mathematics, enabling us to overcome some of the constraints (even dimensional) inherent in conventional visualization approaches. This exploration benefits from dimensionality reduction techniques, which not only lessen computational demands but also highlight potential for describing physical characteristics. The resulting structures encode information about pulsar similarities that extend beyond standard spin parameters, revealing relationships that are not readily apparent in traditional diagrams. With a physically motivated topological perspective, we leverage the strengths of these methods and present results that span from prospective source classification and the emergence of new classes to catalog comparison, among other applications. This new approach enables fresh interpretations of longstanding problems, laying a new foundation for visualizing the pulsar population and categorizing sources. Building on this, we identify several sources as likely members of specific binary subclasses and investigate the potential transitional nature of others. Furthermore, we extend the use of graph theory to the boundary of machine learning, demonstrating its capability for binary separation in an unsupervised context. Finally, we introduce and apply an innovative, flexible time-series alignment technique to the field of gamma-ray astrophysics. The method identifies notable similarities among the light curves of gamma-ray pulsars. The results presented here are promising, offering a refreshing direction for the field and new pathways for rigorous mathematical analysis, ultimately providing meaningful alternatives to traditional approaches in high-energy astrophysics.

 - **Abstract**
 Numerous astronomical and cosmological observations point to the existence of dark matter, which constitutes about 27% of the Universe. Despite extensive efforts, only the DAMA/LIBRA experiment, using NaI(Tl) detectors at Gran Sasso National Laboratory, has reported a positive dark matter signal. To independently verify this result, using the same NaI target is essential. This is the goal of ANAIS-112, operating with 112.5 kg of NaI(Tl) scintillators since 2017 at the Canfranc Underground Laboratory (LSC). This thesis presents work within ANAIS-112, focusing on data analysis and the development of Geant4-based simulations to reduce systematics and increase sensitivity. Efforts have focused on understanding the ANAIS-112 crystals' response to nuclear recoils. Systematic uncertainties related to the scintillation quenching factors (QFs) of sodium and iodine recoiling in NaI(Tl) must be addressed to ensure reliable comparisons with DAMA/LIBRA and other experiments. For that purpose, onsite neutron calibrations in ANAIS-112 have been performed since 2021 at LSC using 252Cf sources. This work has compared calibration data with Geant4-based neutron simulations, which has revealed Geant4 deficiencies in certain decay processes and cross sections in some versions. The simulations have proven highly sensitive to the QF used, favouring models in which the QF increases with energy and disfavouring DAMA values. In parallel, this thesis has contributed to improving the ANAIS-112 background model through a multiparametric fit of its background components. New physics searches have been conducted using ANAIS-112 data, including a reanalysis of the annual modulation signal and a search for solar axions using six years of exposure. Finally, this thesis also includes work within the COSINUS experiment, focused on background modelling and the impact of internal backgrounds on the experiment's sensitivity.
#### Beyond single tracers: CNN-based inference of galaxy mass profiles from combined gas and stellar kinematics
 - **Authors:** Julen Expósito-Márquez, Arianna Di Cintio, Chris Brook, Jorge Sarrato-Alós, Andrea V. Macciò
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19673

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.19673

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate whether combining gas and stellar kinematic maps provides measurable advantages in recovering galaxy mass profiles, compared to using single-component maps alone. While traditional methods struggle to integrate multi-tracer data effectively, we test whether deep learning models can leverage this joint information. We develop a probabilistic convolutional neural network (CNN) framework trained and tested on mock galaxy kinematic maps from multiple cosmological simulation suites. Our model is trained on gas-only, stars-only, and combined gas+stellar velocity maps, allowing direct comparison of performance across tracers. To assess robustness, we include simulations with differing feedback models and galaxy properties. Combining gas and stellar maps reduces the dispersion in the inferred mass profiles by up to a factor of $\sim$1.5 compared to models using either tracer independently. The CNN architecture effectively captures complementary information from the two components. However, we find limitations in generalizing between simulation suites, with reduced performance when applying models trained on one suite to galaxies from another.
#### Exoplanetary radio emission predictions and detectability in the SKA era

 - **Abstract**
 Radio observations provide a window into a planet's interior and play a crucial role in studying its atmosphere and surface, key factors to find potential habitability. The discovery of thousands of exoplanets, together with advances in radio astronomy through the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), motivates the search for planetary-scale radio emissions. Here, we employ the radiometric Bode's law (RBL) and machine learning techniques to analyze a dataset of 1330 confirmed exoplanets, aiming to estimate their potential radio emission. Permutation Importance (PI) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analyses indicate that a planet's mass, radius, orbital semi-major axis, and distance from Earth are sufficient to dependably forecast its radio flux and frequency. The random forest model accurately reproduces these radio characteristics, confirming its reliability for exoplanetary radio predictions. Considering observational constraints, we find that 64 exoplanets could generate signals detectable by the SKA, 52 of which remain observable in the intermediate AA* deployment. Among these, MASCARA-1 b stands out with a predicted flux of 7.209 mJy at 135.1 MHz, making it an excellent SKA-Low target. Meanwhile, WASP-18 b, with a flux of 18.638 mJy peaking at 812.9 MHz, is the most promising candidate for SKA-Mid. These results show that the SKA can detect gas giants, such as MASCARA-1 b (SNR>400) and WASP-18 b (SNR>4236), within feasible integration times. Additionally, we identify four candidates (HATS-18 b, WASP-12 b, WASP-103 b, and WASP-121 b) that are likely affected by radio quenching, highlighting the importance of considering this effect in target selection for observation campaigns.
#### Detecting gravitational lensing by matter currents
 - **Authors:** C. Murray, R. Kou, J. G. Bartlett

Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19798

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.19798

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the observational prospects for detecting gravitational lensing induced by cosmological matter currents, a relativistic correction to the standard scalar lensing effect arising from the motion of matter. We propose to isolate this contribution by cross-correlating the weak-lensing convergence field with a reconstructed cosmic momentum field inferred from galaxy surveys. Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate that this reconstructed momentum field is uncorrelated with the scalar lensing signal, enabling a clean separation of the gravitomagnetic component. We then forecast the detectability of this signal for upcoming wide-field galaxy and weak-lensing surveys, showing that a statistically significant detection may be achievable under realistic observational conditions. Such a measurement would provide the first direct probe of the large-scale cosmic momentum field, offering a novel test of general relativity and Lorentz invariance on cosmological scales.
