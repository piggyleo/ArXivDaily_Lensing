 - **Abstract**
 If dark matter (DM) exists in halos around rotating neutron stars (NSs), it will be essential to understand the effects of rotation on the distribution of DM and baryonic matter (BM) in the stars to interpret observations. In this work, we construct rapidly rotating dark matter admixed neutron stars (DANS) with DM halos using the two-fluid approximation, where the BM and DM interact only through gravity. Our goal is to describe rapidly rotating millisecond-period DANS spun up by the accretion of BM from a zero angular momentum state. We extend the Rapidly Rotating Neutron Star (RNS) code to compute axisymmetric configurations in which the BM rotates rigidly while the DM remains torque-free and differentially rotates through the frame-dragging of spacetime. For the first time, we examine in detail local and global definitions of mass in general relativity for two-fluid systems, showing how their differences affect the interpretation of baryonic and dark component masses. We compute energy density and frame-dragging frequency profiles for DANS with three different characteristic DM halos. We demonstrate that rapid BM rotation reduces DM halo sizes if central energy densities are kept constant between non-rotating and rotating models. We also construct sequences of DANS to create mass and radius curves and compare rotating and non-rotating cases. Finally, we quantify deviations in the spacetime metric outside the baryonic surfaces of these sequences of stars caused by the DM halos. We hypothesize that the size of this quantity could indicate whether a DM halo will significantly impact X-ray pulse profile modeling. These results provide a framework for assessing the observational consequences of DM halos around rapidly rotating NSs.

 - **Abstract**
 Are the most massive objects in the Universe today the direct descendants of the most massive objects at higher redshift? We address this question by tracing the evolutionary histories of haloes in the MultiDark Planck2 simulation. By following the 100 most massive halos at $z = 0$ across cosmic time, we find that only 40\% of them were among the largest 100 halos at $z = 1$. This suggests that many of today's most massive clusters were not the most dominant structures at earlier times, while some of the most massive objects at high redshift do not remain in the top mass ranks at later epochs. The hierarchical nature of structure formation predicts that, on average, massive haloes grow over time, with their abundance in comoving space decreasing rapidly at higher redshifts. However, individual clusters exhibit diverse evolutionary paths: some undergo early rapid growth, while others experience steady accretion or significant merger-driven mass changes. A key assumption in self-similar models of cluster evolution is that the most massive objects maintain their rank in the mass hierarchy across cosmic time. In this work, we test this assumption by constructing a mass-complete sample of haloes within the $(1 h^{-1}{\rm Gpc})^3$ volume of MultiDark and analysing when clusters enter and exit a high-mass-selected sample. Our results demonstrate that cluster selections must be carefully constructed, as significant numbers of objects can enter and leave the sample over time. These findings have important implications for observational cluster selection and comparisons between simulations and surveys, especially at high redshift.
#### Quintessential dark energy crossing the phantom divide

 - **Abstract**
 Motivated by recent results from the DESI collaboration, we explore two classes of quintessence models that can give rise to crossing of the dark energy equation of state through the ``phantom divide'' $w=-1$. These are models with Lagrangians that involve higher powers of the kinetic energy $\dot\phi^2$, or where the dark matter (DM) mass is a function of $\phi$. Both have similar features with respect to the reconstructed redshift-dependent $w(z)$: moderate tuning of parameters is required to achieve the desired shape, and it is difficult or impossible for $w(z)$ to continue evolving smoothly as $z$ becomes large. Nevertheless, they give a strong improvement over $\Lambda$CDM in fitting the data. We point out that models of coupled dark matter and dark energy that cross the phantom divide are under pressure from constraints on long-range DM forces. They rule out the simplest renormalizable coupling of scalar DM to quintessence, but leave the fermionic case marginally allowed, while exponentially coupled models are safe from current constraints.
#### Dark Energy Is Not That Into You: Variable Couplings after DESI DR2 BAO

 - **Abstract**
 In interacting dark energy (DE) and dark matter (DM) scenarios, the interaction function typically includes a coupling parameter $\xi$ that quantifies the strength of energy exchange between the dark sectors. While $\xi$ is often assumed to be constant, there is no fundamental reason to exclude a time-dependent coupling, which could provide a more general and realistic description of dark sector dynamics. In this work, we study two widely used interacting models involving pressureless DM and DE, where the coupling parameter is allowed to vary with the scale factor $a$. Specifically, we consider two parametrizations: $\xi(a) = \xi_0 + \xi_a (1-a)$ and $\xi(a) = \xi_0 \left(1 + \frac{1-a}{a^2 + (1-a)^2} \right)$, and constrain them using the latest cosmological observations, including Planck 2018 CMB data, DESI DR2 BAO measurements, and multiple Type Ia supernovae samples. Our results show that one scenario yields evidence for a non-zero interaction at more than 95\% confidence level, while the remaining cases indicate at most mild or inconclusive signs of interaction. These findings highlight the potential of variable coupling models and the importance of continued investigation into the nature of the dark sectors.

 - **Abstract**
 The dSphs around the Milky Way are commonly considered as systems that are supported by velocity dispersion against self-gravitation. They have been long accounted among the best targets to search for indirect DM signatures in the GeV-to-TeV gamma-rays due to absence of astrophysical gamma-ray foreground or background emission. We present forecasts on the sensitivity of the future CTAO for the search for annihilating or decaying DM in such targets. We perform an original selection of candidates out of the current catalog of known objects, including both classical and ultra-faint targets. For each of them, we calculate the expected amount of DM using the most updated and complete available samples of photometric and spectroscopic data of member stars, adopting a common framework of data treatment for both classes of objects. In this way, we are able to generate novel astrophysical factor profiles for general indirect DM searches that we compare with the current literature. Out of a starting sample of 64 dSphs, we highlight the 8 most promising targets - DraI, CBe, UMaII, UMi and Wil1 in the Northern hemisphere; RetII, Scl and SgrII in the Southern hemisphere - for which different DM density models (either cored or cuspy) lead to similar expectations, at variance with what happens for other DM targets - thus resulting in more robust predictions. We find that CTAO will provide the strongest limits above ~10 TeV, down to values of velocity-averaged annihilation cross section of ~5$ \times 10^{-25}$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1}$ and up to decay lifetimes of ~10$^{26}$ s for combined limits on the best targets. We argue that the largest source of inaccuracy is due to the still imprecise determination of the DM content, especially for ultra-faint dSphs. We propose possible strategies of observation for CTAO, either optimized on a deep focus on the best known candidates, or on the diversification of targets.
#### Probing the HI distribution at small scales using 21-cm Intensity Mapping at large scales

 - **Abstract**
 Neutral hydrogen (HI) 21-cm Intensity Mapping (IM) holds the potential to map the large-scale structures in the Universe over a wide redshift range $(z \lesssim 5.5)$, measure cosmological parameters, and shed light on the nature of dark energy. In addition, the signal is also sensitive to how the HI is distributed among the dark matter haloes, this being quantified through the HIHM relation, which relates the HI mass to the halo mass. In this work, we investigate whether measurements of the 21-cm power spectrum (PS) and bispectrum (BS) at large scales can be used to estimate the HIHM relation, which quantifies the HI distribution at small scales. As a proof of concept, we consider the simulated 21-cm IM signal at $z=1$. We find that the measured 21-cm PS and BS at large scales $(k \le k_{ul} = 0.32 \, {\rm Mpc}^{-1})$ are well modeled using perturbation theory, with only two free parameters namely $[\Omega_{\rm HI} b_1]$ and $\gamma = b_2/b_1$. Combining the measured 21-cm PS and BS with an independent measurement of $\Omega_{\rm HI} $, we show that it is possible to estimate the three parameters that quantify the HIHM relation. We expect observational estimates of the HIHM relation to shed light on galaxy formation and the evolution of the ISM. Our preliminary analysis ignores redshift space distortion and the system noise in IM observations, which we plan to address in future work.
#### The Magnetic Origin of Primordial Black Holes: A Viable Dark Matter Scenario

 - **Abstract**
 Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) are compelling candidates for explaining the present-day relic abundance of cold dark matter (CDM), yet their formation typically requires finely tuned early-universe dynamics. In this work, we propose a novel PBH formation mechanism within a well-established magnetogenesis framework. This scenario simultaneously accounts for the large-scale magnetic fields observed today and generates an enhanced curvature power spectrum at intermediate scales, leading to PBH formation with masses that can survive until the present epoch. We identify a narrow reheating temperature range, $10^5\,\mathrm{GeV} \leq T_{re} \leq 3\times 10^5\,\mathrm{GeV}$, within which the resulting PBHs can constitute the entirety of the observed CDM abundance. Furthermore, our model predicts a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background as a byproduct of the PBH formation process. Remarkably, the predicted GW signal lies within the sensitivity reach of upcoming space-based interferometers, such as the LISA, DECIGO, or SKA mission, offering a direct observational probe of this PBH generation mechanism.
