#### Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) and The Signatures of Cosmic Non-Gaussianity

 - **Abstract**
 Primordial black holes (PBHs) provide a unique probe of the small-scale primordial Uni- verse and may constitute a fraction of the dark matter. Their formation is highly sensitive to non-Gaussian features in the primordial curvature perturbation {\zeta}. In this work we inves- tigate PBH production in the curvaton scenario, where the decay of a late-time light scalar field imprints large, inherently non-Gaussian fluctuations on small scales. Using the exact non-linear mapping between the Gaussian curvaton field perturbations and {\zeta}, we compute the full non-perturbative probability distribution functions of {\zeta} and derive the PBH for- mation fraction \b{eta} without relying on a truncated non-Gaussian expansion. We show that the enhanced tail of the distribution dramatically amplifies PBH production, leading to an exponential sensitivity of \b{eta} to the curvaton decay fraction {\Omega}\c{hi},dec. By modeling the scale dependence of curvaton fluctuations with a lognormal profile, we obtain realistic, extended PBH mass spectra rather than monochromatic peaks. We further highlight the associated stochastic gravitational-wave background induced at second order, whose peak frequency correlates directly with the PBH mass scale. Our results demonstrate that the curvaton scenario naturally produces a rich phenomenology of PBHs and gravitational waves, sharply distinct from Gaussian single-field inflation models, and provide a framework for connecting small-scale non-Gaussian physics to upcoming gravitational-wave and PBH observations.

 - **Abstract**
 It is thought that the Universe went through an early period known as the Dark Ages, during which primeval density fluctuations grew to form the first luminous objects, marking the beginning of Cosmic Dawn around 100 million years after the Big Bang. The 21-cm line of hydrogen atoms is the most promising probe of these epochs, with extensive observational efforts underway. We combine hydrodynamical simulations with a large-scale grid in order to precisely calculate the effect of non-linear structure formation on the global (sky-averaged) 21-cm radio intensity. We show that it presents a potential opportunity to probe the properties of dark matter in a new regime, corresponding to a length-scale of only 150,000 light years and a mass-scale of 20 million Solar masses. This effect can in principle be detected unambiguously during the Dark Ages, where the weak signal requires an array of global signal antennae. During Cosmic Dawn, when stellar radiation boosts the signal, a single global antenna suffices, but the clumping effect must then be separated from the effect of the stars. Our findings open new avenues for testing the nature of dark matter as well as non-standard cosmological models.
#### A Dark Matter Model with Quadratic Equation of State: Background Evolution and Structure Formation

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.11138

 - **Abstract**
 We propose that dark matter (DM) possesses a quadratic equation of state, which becomes significant at high densities, altering the Universe's evolution during its early stages. We derive the modified background evolution equations for the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ and the DM density parameter $\Omega_{\text{dm}}(z)$. We then perturb the governing equations to study the linear growth of matter fluctuations, computing the observable growth factor $f\sigma_8(z)$. Finally, we compare the model with the latest cosmological data, including Hubble parameter $H(z)$ measurements, and growth factor $f\sigma_8(z)$ data, up to $z=3$. Our results indicate that the quadratic model, while remaining consistent with background observations, offers a distinct imprint on the growth of structure, providing not only a new phenomenological avenue to address cosmological tensions but also shedding light on the nature of DM.
#### Probing small-scale dark matter clumping with the large-scale 21-cm power spectrum

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.11175

 - **Abstract**
 The 21-cm line of hydrogen is the most promising probe of the Dark Ages and Cosmic Dawn. We combine hydrodynamical simulations with a large-scale grid in order to calculate the effect of non-linear structure formation on the large-scale 21-cm power spectrum, focusing on redshifts $z=20-40$. As the clumping effect arises from small-scale density fluctuations, it offers a unique opportunity to probe the standard cold dark matter model in a new regime and thus potentially investigate the properties of dark matter. To this end, we also study a warm dark matter $-$ like model with a Gaussian cutoff on a scale of 50 kpc. We find that clumping has a significant impact on the large-scale 21-cm power spectrum. For example, for the Dark Ages case at $z=30$ and wavenumber $k=0.05$ Mpc$^{-1}$, small-scale clustering enhances the 21-cm power spectrum by $13\%$. Once Lyman-$\alpha$ coupling kicks in due to the first stars, the 21-cm signal strengthens, and the effect of clumping grows; it suppresses the observable power spectrum at $z=20$ by a factor of two, while the cutoff model has less than half the clumping impact. The clumping effect is significantly higher than the sensitivity of the planned Square Kilometre Array (SKA) AA$^\star$ configuration, by up to a factor of 20 for standard cold dark matter, though detection will require separation from foregrounds and from astrophysical contributions to the 21-cm power spectrum.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.11215

 - **Abstract**
 We present a technique to search for fast radio bursts in records obtained with broadband radiometers having few radio channels. The technique is applied to the RATAN-600 surveys carried out at its Western Sector since the year 2017. A 1D convolutional neural network for multichannel time series classification is developed based on the EfficientNet family of models. The procedure to generate synthetic FRB signals needed for the training dataset is described. We implement a two-stage cascade scheme to effectively suppress the rate of false positive detections. Evaluation of the trained model is provided based on the synthetic events and the giant pulse of the Crab Pulsar.
#### Probing Hernquist dark matter with black hole shadows: A comprehensive study of various accretions

 - **Abstract**
 The appearance of a black hole shadow, in both astronomical observations and theoretical analysis, depends critically on the properties of the surrounding accretion. In this study, we analyse the emission and observational properties of a Schwarzschild black hole surrounded by a Hernquist dark matter (DM) halo by considering three simplified accretion models, which have not been previously explored in such detail. Based on our findings, direct emission contributes markedly to the whole observed intensity for a Schwarzschild-Hernquist black hole encircled by a geometrically thin accretion disk. The corresponding regions and measured intensities of the lensing ring, the photon ring, and direct emission are sensitive to the parameters of the Hernquist DM halo. Apart from disk accretion, we also study two spherical accretion models: static and infalling. With increasing Hernquist DM parameters, both models exhibit a significant decrease in the measured intensity, yet the photon spheres are enlarged by an increase of $\sim2\%$ to $\sim30\%$. Furthermore, Doppler de-boosting due to the infalling accretion results in darker shadow images compared to static cases. By precising visualisations of the shadows, our results suggest that the observational characteristics of black hole shadows can serve as a powerful probe for distinguishing between different DM distributions around supermassive black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 The strong gravitational pull of the neutron star leads to the accretion of dark matter (DM) inside the core of the neutron star. The accretion of DM affects the bulk properties of the neutron star. Here, we study how the accretion of WIMP (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles) dark matter particles affects the $\Delta-$admixed hyperon star's bulk properties specifically mass, radius, tidal deformability, $f-$mode frequency and moment of inertia. The inclusion of dark matter softens the EOS (equation of state) and reduces the maximum possible mass, canonical radius, canonical tidal deformability, and moment of inertia of canonical star. However, the $f-$mode frequency of the canonical star increases. We find a cubical correlation between the dark matter fermi momenta $k_f^{DM}$ and bulk properties of canonical star.
#### Precise Measurement of the Absolute Sky Brightness at 60 to 350 MHz

 - **Abstract**
 Precise measurement of the sky radio brightness below 1 GHz and estimation of any unaccounted-for extragalactic brightness is required to understand the Galactic cosmic ray electron spectrum, to constrain populations of nanojansky radio sources, and to constrain dark matter annihilation or decay. The foreground radio brightness must also be accurately accounted for when measuring the cosmic background radiation and departures from its Planck spectrum that trace astrophysical processes in the early Universe, cosmic dark ages, cosmic dawn and the epoch of reionisation. Here we report a new, precision measurement of the sky spectral brightness over radio frequencies from 60 MHz to 350 MHz. Our measurement motivates a significant correction to previous all-sky images made in this band and the Global Sky Model (GSM) that is constructed from these and other sky images made at radio wavelengths. We find that the GSM requires subtraction of an offset exceeding 100K below 100 MHz and scaling up by a factor of approximately 1.2 below 200 MHz rising to a factor of 1.5 at 350 MHz, thus significantly enhancing previous estimates of unaccounted excess in radio sky brightness. Our measurements were made with a new receiver architecture that dynamically self-calibrates for receiver noise and bandpass in situ, while connected to an antenna. We used a single, accurately modelled, wideband logperiodic antenna placed on a 40m diameter ground mesh. Our accurate measurement requires upward revision of sky brightness and motivates revisiting models for source populations and dark matter decay. Additionally, sky models scaled to our measurements serve as a stable reference in calibrating the absolute flux density scale for low-frequency radio telescopes. This will be important for calibration accuracy of the SKA-Low telescope, that will operate at the frequencies of our measurements.
#### Testing CCC+TL Cosmology with Galaxy Rotation Curves

 - **Abstract**
 This paper aims to explore whether astrophysical observations, primarily galaxy rotation curves, result from covarying coupling constants (CCC) rather than from dark matter. We have shown in earlier papers that cosmological observations, such as supernovae type 1a (Pantheon+), the small size of galaxies at cosmic dawn, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), the sound horizon in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), and time dilation effect, can be easily accounted for without requiring dark energy and dark matter when coupling constants are permitted to evolve in an expanding Universe, as predicted by Dirac, and the redshift is considered jointly due to the Universe's expansion and Zwicky's tired light (TL) effect. Here, we show that the CCC parameter {\alpha} is responsible for generating the illusion of dark matter and dark energy, which we call {\alpha}-matter and {\alpha}-energy, and is influenced by the baryonic matter density distribution. While cosmologically {\alpha} is a constant determined for the homogenous and isotropic Universe, e.g., by fitting Pantheon+ data, it can vary locally due to the extreme anisotropy of the matter distribution. Thus, in high baryonic density regions, one expects {\alpha}-matter and {\alpha}-energy densities to be relatively low and vice versa. We present its application to a few galaxy rotation curves from the SPARC database and find the results promising.
#### Gravitational Signatures of Axion Dark Matter via Parity-Violating Interactions

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.12038

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate axion-like particles coupled to gravity through a parity-violating Chern-Simons (CS) interaction. In this framework, axion dark matter (DM) can decay into pairs of circularly polarized gravitons, producing a persistent, nearly monochromatic GW signal. We compute the expected signal at Earth assuming a Navarro-Frenk-White Galactic halo model with the corresponding velocity distribution, and compare it with the narrowband sensitivities of the LIGO O4 run and the projected reach of the Einstein Telescope. The resulting bounds on the axion-graviton coupling $\alpha$ improve upon the cosmological stability requirement for axion masses $m_\phi \lesssim 10^{-11}$ eV, excluding values up to four orders of magnitude below the stability limit. This constitutes a robust direct terrestrial constraint on the axion-gravity CS coupling. We also discuss distinctive observational signatures, such as circular polarization asymmetries, annual modulation, and potential enhancements from DM substructures, which could serve as smoking-gun evidence for parity-violating gravitational interactions.

 - **Abstract**
 As the scientific exploitation of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) approaches, there is a need for new advanced data analysis and visualization tools capable of processing large high-dimensional datasets. In this study, we aim to generalize the YOLO-CIANNA deep learning source detection and characterization method for 3D hyperspectral HI emission cubes. We present the adaptations we made to the regression-based detection formalism and the construction of an end-to-end 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) backbone. We then describe a processing pipeline for applying the method to simulated 3D HI cubes from the SKA Observatory Science Data Challenge 2 (SDC2) dataset. The YOLO-CIANNA method was originally developed and used by the MINERVA team that won the official SDC2 competition. Despite the public release of the full SDC2 dataset, no published result has yet surpassed MINERVA's top score. In this paper, we present an updated version of our method that improves our challenge score by 9.5%. The resulting catalog exhibits a high detection purity of 92.3%, best-in-class characterization accuracy, and contains 45% more confirmed sources than concurrent classical detection tools. The method is also computationally efficient, processing the full ~1TB SDC2 data cube in 30 min on a single GPU. These state-of-the-art results highlight the effectiveness of 3D CNN-based detectors for processing large hyperspectral data cubes and represent a promising step toward applying YOLO-CIANNA to observational data from SKA and its precursors.
#### A Short Introduction to Cosmology and its Current Status

 - **Abstract**
 The current cosmological model, known as the $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter model (or $\Lambda$CDM for short) is one of the most astonishing accomplishments of contemporary theoretical physics. It is a well-defined mathematical model which depends on very few ingredients and parameters and is able to make a range of predictions and postdictions with astonishing accuracy. It is built out of well-known physics - general relativity, quantum mechanics and atomic physics, statistical mechanics and thermodynamics - and predicts the existence of new, unseen components. Again and again it has been shown to fit new data sets with remarkable precision. Despite these successes, we have yet to understand the unseen components of the Universe and there has been evidence for inconsistencies in the model. In these lectures, we lay the foundations of modern cosmology.
#### Deriving accurate galaxy cluster masses using X-ray thermodynamic profiles and graph neural networks

 - **Abstract**
 Precise determination of galaxy cluster masses is crucial for establishing reliable mass-observable scaling relations in cluster cosmology. We employ graph neural networks (GNNs) to estimate galaxy cluster masses from radially sampled profiles of the intra-cluster medium (ICM) inferred from X-ray observations. GNNs naturally handle inputs of variable length and resolution by representing each ICM profile as a graph, enabling accurate and flexible modeling across diverse observational conditions. We trained and tested GNN model using state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters from The Three Hundred Project. The mass estimates using our method exhibit no systematic bias compared to the true cluster masses in the simulations. Additionally, we achieve a scatter in recovered mass versus true mass of about 6\%, which is a factor of six smaller than obtained from a standard hydrostatic equilibrium approach. Our algorithm is robust to both data quality and cluster morphology and it is capable of incorporating model uncertainties alongside observational uncertainties. Finally, we apply our technique to XMM-Newton observed galaxy cluster samples and compare the GNN derived mass estimates with those obtained with $Y_{\rm SZ}$-M$_{500}$ scaling relations. Our results provide strong evidence, at 5$\sigma$ level, for a mass-dependent bias in SZ derived masses, with higher mass clusters exhibiting a greater degree of deviation. Furthermore, we find the median bias to be $(1-b)=0.85_{-14}^{+34}$, albeit with significant dispersion due to its mass dependence. This work takes a significant step towards establishing unbiased observable mass scaling relations by integrating X-ray, SZ and optical datasets using deep learning techniques, thereby enhancing the role of galaxy clusters in precision cosmology.
