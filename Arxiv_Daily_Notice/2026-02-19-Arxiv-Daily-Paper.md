 - **Abstract**
 Diffuse radio emission in galaxy clusters, such as radio halos, relics, and mini halos, is a key tracer of non-thermal processes, turbulence, and magnetic fields within the intra-cluster medium. However, their low surface brightness, as well as contamination from compact sources and imaging artefacts, makes their detection challenging. The sheer volume of data from instruments such as the Square Kilometre Array will render traditional manual-inspection based detection methods infeasible. This paper introduces a novel machine learning approach that uses active learning to rapidly identify diffuse emission candidates from a small, optimally-selected subset of data. We apply the self-supervised deep learning algorithm Bootstrap Your Own Latent to extract features from source cutouts in the MeerKAT Galaxy Cluster Legacy Survey (MGCLS). We then pass these features through the Astronomaly: Protege anomaly detection framework to identify the final candidates. Using a human-labelled set, we evaluate our pipeline on high-resolution (~7''), convolved (15''), and combined-feature MGCLS datasets. Interestingly, the high-resolution features identify diffuse sources more efficiently than the convolved resolution, which are in turn outperformed by the combined features. Of the top 100 sources ranked by Protege, 99% exhibit diffuse characteristics, with 55% confirmed as cluster-related emission. Our work shows that Protege can identify diffuse emission with minimal human labelling effort, offering a powerful, scalable tool capable of detecting both known and novel diffuse radio sources.
#### The large cores of dark matter and globular clusters in AS1063. Possible evidence of self-interacting dark matter. Or not

 - **Abstract**
 Deep JWST images of AS1063 reveals tens of thousands of globular clusters in the galaxy cluster AS1063. When compared with the lensing model based on the same JWST data, the distribution of globular clusters traces closely the distribution of lensing mass (mostly composed of dark matter). Interestingly, both the distributions of dark matter and globular clusters have large central cores. However the size of the core in the distribution of globular clusters is about half the size the core of the dark matter distribution. We argue that the standard cold dark matter and fuzzy dark matter models struggle to explain these large cores. Meanwhile, the self interacting dark matter with a velocity dependent cross section, combined with core stalling, offers a natural explanation to the existence of these cores if $\sigma_{\rm SI}\approx 0.3$ cm$^2$ g$^{-1}$ for galaxy cluster halos. But we also discuss how the lack of hydrodynamical N-body simulations capable of resolving globular clusters in galaxy cluster scale halos, hinders the possibility of ruling out the standard non-collisional dark matter scenario. Future high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters, with several trillion particles, and containing over a hundred thousand globular clusters, can provide the insight needed to transform the epistemic nature of dark matter into an ontological one

 - **Abstract**
 The nature of dark matter and dark energy are among the central questions in cosmology. Strong gravitational lenses with multiple source planes provide a geometric probe of cosmology: the ratio of deflection angles at different redshifts depends only on angular-diameter distances, constraining the matter density $\Omega_m$ and the dark energy equation of state $w$. However, constraints from this technique have historically lagged behind those from the CMB, SNe Ia, and BAO. In this work, we present new cosmological constraints from the Carousel Lens, a cluster-scale lens with more than 40 extended images from 11 spectroscopically confirmed sources. Its relaxed core and rich set of extended images behind the main halo make it particularly suitable for cosmological inference. Using the GIGA-Lens pipeline, we construct a pixel-level lens model including six HST-detected sources and four mass components. From this model, we obtain $w$CDM constraints of $\Omega_m = 0.34^{+0.16}_{-0.13}$ and $w = -1.31^{+0.35}_{-0.32}$ from the Carousel Lens alone, accounting for both statistical and systematic uncertainties. We further project that including four additional known higher-redshift sources, assuming similar fractional uncertainties, could improve the constraining power by ~80%, bringing the precision close to that of the CMB and SNe Ia. For an evolving dark energy model ($w_0w_a$CDM), the Carousel Lens alone yields constraints comparable to the CMB, providing an independent and complementary probe alongside SN Ia and BAO. While currently systematic uncertainties dominate, which we quantify through simulations, our results demonstrate that relaxed multi-source-plane cluster lenses can deliver competitive cosmological constraints. Further improvements are expected from reductions in systematics and from incorporating higher-redshift sources (known and new) with high-resolution imaging.
#### High significance detection at 4.8 GHz of the radio halo in the Coma galaxy cluster with the Sardinia Radio Telescope

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of observations of the radio halo in the Coma galaxy cluster at 4.8 GHz performed with the Sardinia Radio Telescope. The radio halo in this cluster is detected for the first time at this frequency with a statistical significance higher than $3\sigma$. After the removal of the Radio Frequency Interference and of the discrete sources contribution, and after the correction for the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, we estimate a flux density of $61\pm11$ mJy, higher than the value previously reported in literature at this frequency. By using the value we obtained, it is possible to estimate an integrated spectral index between 4.8 and 6.6 GHz of $\alpha\sim1.17$, where $F(\nu)\propto \nu^{-\alpha}$, indicating a possible higher-frequency slowdown of the spectral steepening observed between 1.4 and 4.8 GHz. Such a spectral behavior is compatible with turbulent re-acceleration if the seed electrons have a spectrum extending up to high energies, as in the case of continuous injection by hadronic interactions or dark matter annihilation. We also report the detection at 4.8 GHz of a polarized spot inside the halo, without an evident counterpart, already detected at 6.6 GHz.
