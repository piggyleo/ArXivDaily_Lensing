#### The Ray Tracing Sampler: Bayesian Sampling of Neural Networks for Everyone
 - **Authors:** Peter Behroozi
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Machine Learning (stat.ML)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25824

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25824

 - **Abstract**
 We derive a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler based on following ray paths in a medium where the refractive index $n(x)$ is a function of the desired likelihood $\mathcal{L}(x)$. The sampling method propagates rays at constant speed through parameter space, leading to orders of magnitude higher resilience to heating for stochastic gradients as compared to Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), as well as the ability to cross any likelihood barrier, including holes in parameter space. Using the ray tracing method, we sample the posterior distributions of neural network outputs for a variety of different architectures, up to the 1.5 billion-parameter GPT-2 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2) architecture, all on a single consumer-level GPU. We also show that prior samplers including traditional HMC, microcanonical HMC, Metropolis, Gibbs, and even Monte Carlo integration are special cases within a generalized ray tracing framework, which can sample according to an arbitrary weighting function.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the development of a large-volume, wide field-of-view time projection chamber (TPC) for X-ray polarimetry, featuring a triple-GEM amplification stage and optical readout. Originally developed within the CYGNO program for directional dark matter searches, the system employs a scientific CMOS (sCMOS) camera and a photomultiplier tube (PMT) to collect secondary scintillation light produced during charge amplification. A prototype with a cylindrical active volume (radius 3.7 cm, height 5 cm) was tested at the INAF--IAPS calibration facility (Rome, Tor Vergata) to assess sensitivity to low-energy electron directionality. We fully reconstruct electrons in the 10-60 keV range, obtain angular resolutions as good as 15°, and infer modulation factors up to 0.9. These first results demonstrate robust photoelectron tracking at tens of keV with strong modulation, indicating that photoelectric-effect polarimetry can be extended to higher energies. This capability is promising for rapid transients (GRBs, solar flares) and would broaden the astrophysical reach of X-ray polarimetry.
#### Weak-Lensing Detection of Intercluster Filaments in Three Nearby Cluster Systems

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26318

 - **Abstract**
 Direct detection of intercluster filaments is challenging due to their low surface density, resulting in a weak deflection field. We present weak-lensing detections of intercluster filaments using wide-field Dark Energy Camera (DECam) observations from the Local Volume Complete Cluster Survey (LoVoCCS). A matched-filter method was applied to identify filamentary structures in three nearby ($z < 0.1$) systems centered on Abell 401, Abell 2029, and Abell 3558. We discover two prominent filaments ($\geq 4\sigma$) in each system, with the strongest detections ($6.4\sigma - 7.3\sigma$) around Abell 401 and Abell 2029. In particular, we report the first robust weak-lensing detections $(>5 \sigma)$ of the intercluster bridges connecting the cluster pairs Abell 401/399, Abell 2029/2033, Abell 2029/SIG, and Abell 3558/3556. Adopting a filament convergence model motivated by numerical simulations, we infer the maximum convergence ($\kappa_0$) and characteristic width ($h_{\mathrm{c}}$) for all six filaments, yielding $\kappa_0 \sim 0.015 - 0.053$ and $h_{\mathrm{c}} \sim 0.11 - 0.45 \ \mathrm{Mpc}$. The performance of the matched-filter technique is validated using mock shear catalogs and further tested on a null field around Abell 2351. We also explore the potential of using the B-mode lensing signal of filaments to suppress cluster-induced shear contamination. These results demonstrate the feasibility of directly mapping dark matter filaments with current and future wide-field weak-lensing datasets.
#### Model-independent late-universe measurements of $H_0$ and $Ω_\mathrm{K}$ with the PAge-improved inverse distance ladder

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26355

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26355

 - **Abstract**
 The standard $\Lambda{\rm CDM}$ model has encountered serious challenges and the $H_0$ tension has become more significant with increasingly precise cosmological observation. Meanwhile, inconsistencies in measurements of the curvature parameter $\Omega_\mathrm{K}$ between different datasets also have emerged. In this work, we employ two global and cosmic age-based parameterizations, PAge and MAPAge, to perform model-independent measurements of the Hubble constant $H_0$ and $\Omega_\mathrm{K}$ by utilizing the inverse distance ladder (IDL). To construct the PAge-improved IDL, we utilize the strong gravitational lensing (SGL), cosmic chronometers (CC), and gamma ray bursts (GRB) data to calibrate the latest DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation data and DESY5 type Ia supernova data. Our analysis indicate that DESI+DESY5+SGL+CC+GRB gives $H_0=71.59\pm 0.94\,{\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ in the MAPAge model, reducing the $H_0$ tension to the $1.0\sigma$ level. Extending to MAPAge$+\Omega_{\rm K}$ model, we obtain $\Omega_\mathrm{K}=0.001\pm 0.038$, which suggests that current late-time data are consistent with a flat universe. Finally, the Bayesian analysis indicates that the present late-universe data provide weak to moderate evidence in favor of PAge and MAPAge relative to $\Lambda{\rm CDM}$.
#### A test of invariance of halo surface density for FIRE-2 simulations with cold dark matter and self-interacting dark matter
 - **Authors:** Sujit K. Dalui, Shantanu Desai
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26545

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26545

 - **Abstract**
 Numerous observations have shown that the dark matter halo surface density, defined as the product of core radius and halo central density of cored dark matter haloes is nearly constant and independent of galaxy mass over a whole slew of galaxy types. Here we calculate the surface density in cold dark matter(CDM) and self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) models including baryons, as well as SIDM without baryons, for dwarf galaxies of masses $\approx 10^{10} M_{\odot}$ using mock catalogs obtained from simulations as part of the Feedback In Realistic Environments project. We find that the dark matter surface density and column density are nearly constant for CDM and SIDM for this mass range. The halo surface density obtained from the Burkert profile fit is consistent with galactic-scale observations within $1\sigma$. We also computed the empirical scaling relations between the central surface density and maximum velocity using the best-fit dark matter profiles, and found that they agree with observations of Milky Way and M31 dwarfs.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy mergers trigger starburst activity and galactic outflows that enrich the circumgalactic medium, profoundly impacting galaxy evolution. These phenomena are intrinsically linked to the physical conditions of the medium, which is permeated by magnetic (B) fields affecting its transport and dynamics. Here, we spatially resolve, $0.24$" (96 pc), the B-fields in the dusty and molecular outflows of Arp 220, the closest ($78$ Mpc) Ultra-Luminous Infrared Galaxy hosting two interacting nuclei, denoted as East and West. We perform ALMA $870~\mu$m dust continuum polarization and CO(3-2) emission line polarization, and report the first detection of CO(3-2) emission line polarization through the Goldreich-Kylafis effect in an outflow. Dust polarization shows that Arp 220 E has a spiral-like B-field on the disk with a linear polarization fraction of $0.4\pm0.1$% that may produce the detected circular polarization passing through foreground aligned dust grains. Arp 220 W reveals a B-field parallel to the red- and blueshifted outflows in both the dust and emission line polarization maps. The outflows show a dust polarization of $0.2$%, while the CO(3-2) emission line polarization is $1-2$% at $4-6\sigma$ significance across independent velocity channels. A highly polarized ($3-5$%) dusty bridge has a B-field orientation of $\sim110^{\circ}$ connecting both nuclei. Mean B-field strengths of $1.6$ mG and $8$ mG for the blue- and redshifted outflows, respectively, are estimated. These strong B-fields are attributed to amplification by compression in nuclear clouds and supernova remnants. This amplified B-field is likely sustained by the turbulent kinetic energy in the outflow and may be critical in directing the transport of metals and cosmic rays into the circumgalactic medium.
#### Hybrid Physical-Neural Simulator for Fast Cosmological Hydrodynamics
 - **Authors:** Arne Thomsen, Tilman Tröster, François Lanusse

Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Machine Learning (cs.LG)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26593

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26593

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmological field-level inference requires differentiable forward models that solve the challenging dynamics of gas and dark matter under hydrodynamics and gravity. We propose a hybrid approach where gravitational forces are computed using a differentiable particle-mesh solver, while the hydrodynamics are parametrized by a neural network that maps local quantities to an effective pressure field. We demonstrate that our method improves upon alternative approaches, such as an Enthalpy Gradient Descent baseline, both at the field and summary-statistic level. The approach is furthermore highly data efficient, with a single reference simulation of cosmological structure formation being sufficient to constrain the neural pressure model. This opens the door for future applications where the model is fit directly to observational data, rather than a training set of simulations.
