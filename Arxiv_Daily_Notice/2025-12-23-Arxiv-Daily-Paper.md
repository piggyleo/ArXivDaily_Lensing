#### First-Principles Formalism for Simulating Self-Interacting Dark Matter

 - **Abstract**
 It is plausible that the dark matter particles have non-gravitational interactions among themselves. If such self interactions are large enough, they could leave an imprint on the morphology of galaxies. These effects can be studied with numerical simulations, which serve as the primary tool to predict the non-linear evolution of galactic structure. A standard assumption is that the course-grained phase-space distribution of the macroscopic simulation particles follows the same evolution equation as that of the fundamental dark matter particles. This Letter tests this assumption directly for the case of frequent dark matter scatterings, demonstrating that this is not generically true. Specifically, we develop a first-principles map from a microscopic particle physics description of self-interacting dark matter to a representation of macroscopic simulation particles for theories in the short-mean-free-path regime. Using this procedure, we show the emergence of an effective force between the simulation particles and derive their interaction cross section, which depends on the one from fundamental particle physics. This work provides the first explicit map from particle physics to simulation, which will facilitate exploring the phenomenological implications for galactic dynamics.
#### The Clustering of Little Red Dots from Ultra-Strongly Self-Interacting Dark Matter

 - **Abstract**
 We predict the effective clustering bias parameter, $b_{\rm{eff}}$, at $z\sim5$ for Little Red Dots (LRDs) seeded by Ultra-Strongly Self-Interacting Dark Matter (uSIDM). From our model, we find that $b_{\rm{eff}}\sim4.5$, thus we infer that LRDs seeded by uSIDM would populate halos of typical masses $\sim 8\times10^{10}~M_{\odot}$; this bias factor is consistent with LRDs being a distinct population from high redshift quasars. To the extent that we are aware, this is the first formation-based theoretical prediction of LRD clustering from a model consistent with the LRD mass function. We find that this bias and clustering is insensitive to a wide range of the underlying uSIDM microphysics parameters, including the uSIDM cross-section $\sigma/m$ and uSIDM fraction $f$. This is therefore a robust prediction from the uSIDM model, and will allow for direct probes of the uSIDM paradigm as the origin of LRDs in the next few years. Upcoming \texttt{JWST} observations will constrain the population of LRDs, including directly measuring their clustering.

 - **Abstract**
 The Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV DR17 Extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) consists of 2,233,939 high-quality optical galaxy spectra obtained through 2" fibers, providing a rich spectroscopic resource for studying galaxy evolution across a broad redshift range. eBOSS was designed primarily for large-scale structure and BAO measurements and, as such, focused on galaxy redshifts, leaving much of the information contained in the spectra unexplored. In addition to the trove of spectra, the large number of repeat observations (197,521 duplicate spectra) enables evaluation of the survey's spectrophotometric quality. To unlock this potential, we introduce the eBOSS Data Analysis Pipeline (eBOSS-DAP), adapted from the MaNGA-DAP, which delivers uniform measurements of emission-line fluxes and equivalent widths, stellar and gas kinematics, continuum spectral indices, and stellar population fits. Using the eBOSS-DAP, we successfully analyze 1,899,553 high-quality galaxy spectra below a redshift of $z < 1.12$ to produce an extensive spectroscopic catalog for the eBOSS galaxy sample. We characterize the calibration performance, quantify the reliability of the derived measurements, and release a suite of data products that fully exploit the power of the eBOSS dataset. These catalogs open the door to a new generation of studies in galaxy evolution and cosmology.
#### Unlocking the physics of dwarf galaxies in the 2040s: The case for a next-generation wide-field spectroscopic facility with fibres and IFUs

 - **Abstract**
 Dwarf galaxies ($M_{\star} \lesssim 10^{9} M_{\odot}$) are the most numerous galaxies in the Universe and critical probes of dark matter, baryonic feedback, and galaxy formation. Despite significant progress from wide-field imaging surveys, the majority of dwarf candidates beyond the Local Group will lack spectroscopic follow-up, leaving fundamental questions about their internal kinematics, stellar populations, chemical enrichment, and dark matter content unresolved. Existing and planned facilities cannot efficiently provide the necessary spectroscopy for low-surface-brightness dwarfs over wide areas. We advocate for a dedicated large-aperture ($\geq 20$ m), wide-field, highly multiplexed spectroscopic facility with deployable or monolithic IFUs, capable of high signal-to-noise observations down to $I_{\rm E} \gtrsim 22-23$ mag. Such a facility would enable transformative studies of dark matter cores, baryonic feedback, tidal interactions, environmental effects, and stellar populations, extending the spectroscopic exploration of low-mass galaxies to $z \sim 1.5$, and providing decisive tests of $\Lambda$CDM and alternative dark matter models. Beyond dwarfs, this capability would impact galaxy evolution, strong and weak lensing studies, and cosmology, ensuring that imaging data from the 2030s and 2040s can be fully exploited.

 - **Abstract**
 The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) data stream will inevitably contain gaps due to maintenance and environmental disturbances, introducing nonstationarities and spectral leakage that compromise standard frequency-domain likelihood evaluations. We present a scalable Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) framework capable of robust parameter estimation directly from gapped time-series data. We employ Flow Matching Posterior Estimation (FMPE) conditioned on a learned summary of the data, optimized through an end-to-end training strategy. To address the computational challenges of long-duration signals, we propose a dual-pathway summarizer architecture: a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) operating on the time domain for high precision, and a novel wavelet-based 2D CNN utilizing asymmetric, dilated kernels to achieve scalability for datasets spanning months. We demonstrate the efficacy of this framework on simulated Galactic Binary-like signals, showing that our joint training approach yields tighter, unbiased posteriors compared to two-stage reconstruction pipelines. Furthermore, we provide the first systematic comparison showing that FMPE offers superior stability and coverage calibration over conventional Normalizing Flows in the presence of severe data artifacts.
#### The Extended Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation for MaNGA Galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 The baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (BTFR), a relationship between rotational velocity and baryonic mass in spiral galaxies, probes the relative content of baryonic and dark matter in galaxies and thus provides a good test of Lambda CDM. Using H-alpha kinematics to model the rotation curves of spiral galaxies, we construct the BTFR for 5743 SDSS MaNGA DR17 galaxies. To extend the BTFR to higher masses using elliptical galaxies, we estimate their total masses from their stellar velocity dispersions using the virial theorem and define the effective rotational velocity as the velocity a rotation-supported galaxy would exhibit given this mass. The baryonic mass of spiral galaxies is composed of stellar, HI, H2, and He mass, while only the stellar mass is used for the baryonic content of ellipticals. We construct and fit the BTFR for a matched subsample of spiral and elliptical MaNGA and IllustrisTNG 100-1 (TNG100) galaxies, finding BTFR slopes between 3.2 and 4.0. We fit a joint BTFR for the 5743 MaNGA spiral and elliptical galaxies and find a BTFR slope of 3.54 (+0.65/-0.48), which is in good agreement with TNG100 galaxies with baryonic masses greater than 10^9 Msun for which we find a BTFR slope of 3.57 (+0.48/-0.37). Within this mass range, the MaNGA galaxies are consistent with both the Lambda CDM simulation and the prediction from MOND; a sample of lower mass galaxies is necessary to differentiate between the two models.
#### Constraints on the polarization angle oscillations of the Crab Nebula with the Simons Array and its applications to the search for axion-like particles

 - **Abstract**
 We present a search for polarization oscillation of the Crab Nebula, also known as Tau A, at millimeter wavelengths using observations with the Simons Array, the successor experiment to POLARBEAR. We follow up on previous work by POLARBEAR using 90 GHz band data of the 2023 observing season of the Simons Array to evaluate the variability of Tau A's polarization angle. Tau A is widely used as a polarization angle calibration source in millimeter-wave astronomy, and thus it is necessary to validate the stability. Additionally, an interesting application of the time-resolved polarimetry of Tau A is to search for axion-like particles (ALPs). We do not detect a global signal across the frequencies considered in this analysis and place a median 95% upper bound of polarization oscillation amplitude $A<0.12^{\circ}$ over oscillation frequencies from 3.39 year$^{-1}$ to 1.50 day$^{-1}$. This constrains the ALP-photon coupling at a median 95% upper bound of $g_{a\gamma\gamma}< 3.84\times 10^{-12}\times\left(m_a/10^{-21}\,\mathrm{eV}\right)$ in the mass range from $4.4\times10^{-22}$ to $7.2\times10^{-20}$ eV, assuming the ALP constitutes all of dark matter, its field is a stochastic Gaussian field, and it is the sole source of Tau A's polarization angle oscillation. Additionally, we do not detect signal at the frequencies where 2.5$\sigma$ hints were previously reported by POLARBEAR, but we do not exclude these signals at the 95% confidence level.

 - **Abstract**
 High Performance Computing (HPC) based simulations are crucial in Astrophysics and Cosmology (A&C), helping scientists investigate and understand complex astrophysical phenomena. Taking advantage of exascale computing capabilities is essential for these efforts. However, the unprecedented architectural complexity of exascale systems impacts legacy codes. The SPACE Centre of Excellence (CoE) aims to re-engineer key astrophysical codes to tackle new computational challenges by adopting innovative programming paradigms and software (SW) solutions. SPACE brings together scientists, code developers, HPC experts, hardware (HW) manufacturers, and SW developers. This collaboration enhances exascale A&C applications, promoting the use of exascale and post-exascale computing capabilities. Additionally, SPACE addresses high-performance data analysis for the massive data outputs from exascale simulations and modern observations, using machine learning (ML) and visualisation tools. The project facilitates application deployment across platforms by focusing on code repositories and data sharing, integrating European astrophysical communities around exascale computing with standardised SW and data protocols.
#### Weak Lensing Mass Calibration of the ACT DR5 Galaxy Clusters with the DES Year 3 Weak Lensing Data

 - **Abstract**
 We use weak gravitational lensing measurements from Year 3 Dark Energy Survey data to calibrate the masses of 443 galaxy clusters selected via the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect from Atacama Cosmology Telescope Data Release 5 maps of the cosmic microwave background. We incorporate redshift and SZ measurements for individual clusters into a hierarchical model for the stacked lensing signals and perform Bayesian analyses to constrain the hydrostatic mass bias of the clusters. Our treatment of systematic uncertainties includes a prescription for measuring and accounting for the weak lensing boost factor, consideration of a miscentering effect, as well as marginalization over uncertainties in the source galaxy photometric redshift distributions and shear calibration. The resultant constraints on the normalization of the mass-observable relation have a precision of approximately 7\%, with the mean WL halo mass of $M_{\rm 500c} = 5.4 \times 10^{14} M_{\odot}$. We measure the bias between the true cluster mass and the mass estimated from the SZ signal based on an X-ray--calibrated scaling relation assuming hydrostatic equilibrium, to be $1-b = 0.75^{+0.04}_{-0.06}$ over the full sample. When splitting the clusters into high ($z$=0.43-0.70) and low ($z$=0.15-0.43) redshift bins, we measure $1-b = 0.58^{+0.06}_{-0.05}$ and $0.82^{+0.07}_{-0.07}$, respectively. When introducing additional freedom in redshift and mass to the hydrostatic bias model, we find that $1-b$ decreases with redshift (with the power law of $-2.0^{+0.7}_{-0.4}$, 99.95\% confidence), consistent with findings from other recent studies, while we do not find any significant trend in mass. We also demonstrate that our result is robust against various systematics. The weak-lensing mass calibration presented in this study will be a useful tool for using the ACT clusters as probes of astrophysics and cosmology.

 - **Abstract**
 Numerical galaxy formation simulations are sensitive to numerical methods and sub-grid physics models, making code comparison projects essential for quantifying uncertainties. Here, we evaluate GADGET4-OSAKA within the AGORA project framework by conducting a systematic comparison with its predecessor. We perform an isolated disk galaxy and a cosmological zoom-in run of a Milky Way-mass halo, following the multi-step AGORA calibration procedure. By systematically deconstructing the updated stellar feedback model, we demonstrate that mechanical momentum injection is necessary to suppress unphysical gas fragmentation and regulate star formation, yielding agreement with the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation. Meanwhile, stochastic thermal heating is essential for driving a hot, metal-enriched gaseous halo, thereby creating a multiphase circumgalactic medium that is absent in the predecessor code. In the cosmological context, we calibrate the simulation to match the stellar mass growth history targeted by the AGORA collaboration. The validated GADGET4-OSAKA simulation has been contributed to the AGORA CosmoRun suite, providing a new data point for understanding the impact of numerical and physical modeling choices on galaxy evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Searching for fleeting radio transients like fast radio bursts (FRBs) with wide-field radio telescopes has become a common challenge in data-intensive science. Conventional algorithms normally cost enormous time to seek candidates by finding the correct dispersion measures, of which the process is so-called dedispersion. Here we present a novel scheme to identify FRB signals from raw data without dedispersion using Machine Learning (ML). Under the data environment for multibeam receivers, we train the EfficientNet model and achieve both exceeding 92% accuracy and precision in FRB recognition. We find that the searching efficiency can be significantly enhanced without the procedure of dedispersion compared with conventional softwares like TransientX and presto. Specifically, the impact of radio frequency interference (RFI) for single-beam and multibeam data has been investigated, and we find ML can naturally mitigate RFI under the multibeam environment. Finally, we validate the trained model on actual data from the current FRB surveys carried out by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope, which provides considerable potential for real implementation in the future.

 - **Abstract**
 Axion-like particles (ALPs) are hypothetical pseudoscalar bosons that arise in many extensions of the Standard Model and are well-motivated dark matter candidates. Nearby massive stars in the late stages of stellar evolution provide a promising environment for enhanced ALP production due to their high core temperatures and densities. We search for a combined signal of ALP-induced hard X-ray and soft $\gamma$-ray emission from 18 nearby pre-supernova stars using the full public 22-year INTEGRAL/SPI dataset, construct individual stellar spectra and link them in a coherent analysis. A maximum-likelihood approach is used to extract fluxes in the 20--2000 keV energy range. Stellar evolution models are employed to obtain the expected spectral shapes of ALP production processes peaking between 50--500 keV, depending on stellar mass and evolutionary stage. We construct a joint likelihood that incorporates uncertainties in stellar parameters to derive combined constraints on the coupling constants $g_{a\gamma}$ and $g_{ae}$ as a function of the ALP mass $m_a$. The hard X-ray and soft $\gamma$-ray fluxes of all selected stars are consistent with zero within uncertainties. We provide upper limits on the continuum emission and on the 511 keV and 1809 keV line fluxes. The combined upper limit on $g_{a\gamma} \times g_{ae}$ is $(0.008 - 2) x 10^{-24}$ GeV$^{-1}$ (95% C.I.) while the ALP-photon coupling is constrained to $g_{a\gamma} = (0.13 - 1.26) x 10^{-11}$ GeV$^{-1}$ (95% C.I.) for $m_a\leqq10^{-11}$ eV, depending on the time to core collapse and magnetic field assumptions. Conservative limits of $(0.27 - 1.25) x 10^{-24}$ GeV$^{-1}$ (95% C.I.) are obtained assuming all but one star are in the early He-burning phase. These results rank among the strongest limits on ALP couplings to date and demonstrate the importance of soft $\gamma$-ray observations for probing ALPs and massive star evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Science is currently at an age where there is more data than we know how to deal with. Machine learning (ML) is an emerging tool that is useful in drawing valuable science out of incomprehensibly large datasets, identifying complex trends in data that are otherwise overlooked. Moreover, ML can potentially enhance the quality and quantity of scientific data as it is collected. This paper explores how a new ML method can improve the rate of classification of rare Ic-BL supernovae (SNe). New parameters called magnitude rates were introduced to train ML models to identify SNe Ic-BL in large datasets. The same methodology was applied to a population of SN Ia transients to see if the methodology could be reproducible with another SN class. Three magnitudes, three time differences, two magnitude rates and the second derivative of these rates were calculated using the first three available photometric data points in a single filter. Initial investigations show that the Random Forest algorithm provides a strong foundation for the early classifications SNe Ic-BL and SNe Ia. Testing this model again on an unseen dataset shows that the model can identify upward of 13% of the total true SN Ic-BL population, significantly improving upon current methods. By implementing a dedicated observation campaign using this model, the number of SN Ic-BL classified and the quality of early-time data collected each year will see considerable growth in the near future.

 - **Abstract**
 Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are key drivers of space weather events, posing risks to both space-borne and ground-based systems. Accurate prediction of their arrival time at Earth is critical for impact mitigation. To this end, physics-informed artificial intelligence (AI) approaches have proven more effective than purely data-driven or physics-based methods, generally offering higher accuracy and better explainability than the former and lower computational cost than the latter. In this work, we propose a generalization of the physics-driven AI framework based on the classical drag-based model (DBM) by integrating the extended version of the drag-based model (EDBM). This enhancement allows us to include in the training process CME events whose interplanetary dynamics are incompatible with those assumed by the DBM. We achieve travel-time prediction accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods. We also perform a parametric robustness analysis, highlighting the stability of our approach under small variations in the drag coefficient. Furthermore, we propose a categorization of CMEs into speed regimes defined by the EDBM using a multiclass classification model based on logistic regression, which could be implemented in near-real-time operational space weather forecasting systems. The results show that the EDBM framework broadens the applicability of forecasting models while preserving good predictive accuracy.

 - **Abstract**
 The search for primordial gravitational waves is a central goal of cosmic microwave background (CMB) surveys. Isolating the characteristic $B$-mode polarization signal sourced by primordial gravitational waves is challenging for several reasons: the amplitude of the signal is inherently small; astrophysical foregrounds produce $B$-mode polarization contaminating the signal; and secondary $B$-mode polarization fluctuations are produced via the conversion of $E$ modes. Current and future low-noise, multi-frequency observations enable sufficient precision to address the first two of these challenges such that secondary $B$ modes will become the bottleneck for improved constraints on the amplitude of primordial gravitational waves. The dominant source of secondary $B$-mode polarization is gravitational lensing by large scale structure. Various strategies have been developed to estimate the lensing deflection and to reverse its effects the CMB, thus reducing confusion from lensing $B$ modes in the search for primordial gravitational waves. However, a few complications remain. First, there may be additional sources of secondary $B$-mode polarization, for example from patchy reionization or from cosmic polarization rotation. Second, the statistics of delensed CMB maps can become complicated and non-Gaussian, especially when advanced lensing reconstruction techniques are applied. We previously demonstrated how a deep learning network, ResUNet-CMB, can provide nearly optimal simultaneous estimates of multiple sources of secondary $B$-mode polarization. In this paper, we show how deep learning can be applied to estimate and remove multiple sources of secondary $B$-mode polarization, and we further show how this technique can be used in a likelihood analysis to produce nearly optimal, unbiased estimates of the amplitude of primordial gravitational waves.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work we assess the implications of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope DR6 measurements for two interacting dark radiation scenarios previously shown to mitigate the Hubble tension. The first model, Wess-Zumino dark radiation (WZDR), features a mass threshold in the dark sector that induces a step-like reduction in the dark radiation abundance as the dark temperature evolves. The second model, new atomic dark matter (nuADaM), introduces dark radiation that remains coupled to a subcomponent of dark matter until shortly before matter-radiation equality. Earlier analyses using Planck data demonstrated that these interactions significantly relax constraints on the dark radiation density and allow values of $H_0$ consistent with local distance-ladder determinations. Incorporating ACT DR6, which extends CMB measurements deep into the high-$\ell$ damping tail, we find that constraints on the additional radiation component tighten substantially in both scenarios, closing most of the parameter space that previously enabled higher values of $H_0$. We further analyze a generalized model including both free-streaming and self-interacting dark radiation, and show that the resulting constraints are consistent with ACT's findings for the limiting cases of purely free-streaming or purely self-interacting radiation. Overall, ACT DR6 significantly restricts interacting dark radiation as a solution to the Hubble tension.
