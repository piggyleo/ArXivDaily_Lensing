 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy interaction classification remains challenging due to complex morphological patterns and the limited interpretability of deep learning models. We propose an attentive neural ensemble that combines AG-XCaps, H-SNN, and ResNet-GRU architectures, trained on the Galaxy Zoo DESI dataset and enhanced with LIME to enable explainable predictions. The model achieves Precision = 0.95, Recall = 1.00, F1 = 0.97, and Accuracy = 96%, outperforming a Random Forest baseline by significantly reducing false positives (23 vs. 70). This lightweight (0.45 MB) and scalable framework provides an interpretable and efficient solution for large-scale surveys such as Euclid and LSST, advancing data-driven studies of galaxy evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 The Javalambre-Physics of the Accelerating Universe Astrophysical Survey (J-PAS) is an ongoing survey mapping thousands of square degrees in the Northern Hemisphere using 56 narrow-band filters, delivering IFU-like photometric data well suited for studying galaxy properties and evolution. As a precursor, the miniJPAS survey observed a 1 deg$^2$ field with the same filter system, providing an ideal testbed for the study of spatially resolved galaxies. In this work, we investigate the resolved stellar population and emission-line properties of 51 miniJPAS galaxies, classified by spectral type (red or blue) and environment (group or field), and assess the role of environment in galaxy evolution. We use the Py2DJPAS pipeline to process the data, homogenise the images to a common PSF, define galactic regions, and extract photo-spectra. Radial profiles are analysed using elliptical annuli spaced by 0.7 R_EFF, combined with an inside-out segmentation to study star formation histories. Stellar population parameters are derived with the Bayesian SED-fitting code BaySeAGal, while artificial neural networks are used to estimate the equivalent widths of the H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, [NII], and [OIII] emission lines. We find clear trends in a mass density-colour diagram: denser, redder regions are older, more metal-rich, and have lower specific star formation rates, while bluer, less dense regions show stronger emission lines and higher sSFRs. Red and blue galaxies are well separated in these relations, whereas environmental classification shows no clear distinction. Radial profiles support an inside-out formation scenario, with significant differences between red and blue galaxies but no strong environmental dependence. We suggest that the weak environmental effects may be due to the relatively low stellar masses of the galaxy groups in our sample.
#### Measuring the Vertical Structure of Active Galactic Nuclei Disks with Transformer Models and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory

 - **Abstract**
 Reverberation mapping is one of the main techniques used to study active galactic nuclei (AGN) accretion disks. Traditional continuum reverberation mapping uses short lags between variability in different wavelength AGN light curves on the light crossing timescale of the disk to measure the radial structure of the disk. The harder-to-detect long negative lag measures lags on the longer inflow timescale, opening up a new window to mapping out the vertical structure of AGN disks. The Vera Rubin Observatory, with its 6 wavebands, long baseline, and high cadence, will revolutionize our ability to detect short and long lags. However, many challenges remain to detect these long lags, such as seasonal gaps in Rubin light curves, the weak signal strength of the long lag relative to the short lag, and the enormous influx of data for millions of AGN from Rubin. Machine learning techniques have the potential to solve many of these issues, but have yet to be applied to the long negative lag problem. We develop and train a transformer-based machine learning model to detect long and short lags in mock Rubin AGN light curves. Our model identifies whether a light curve in our test set has a long negative lag with 96% recall and 0.04% contamination, and is 98% accurate at predicting the true long lag. This accuracy is an enormous improvement over two baseline methods we test on the same mock light curves, the interpolated cross correlation function and javelin, which are only 54% and 21% accurate, respectively.
#### Bound Dark Energy: Particle Physics model in alignment with recent DESI cosmological measurements

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.08943

 - **Abstract**
 We present observational constraints on the Bound Dark Energy Cold Dark Matter (BDE-CDM) model using DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation measurements combined with Planck CMB data and Type Ia supernovae compilations (PantheonPlus, Union3, DESY5). In BDE-CDM, dark energy originates from the lightest meson field within a supersymmetric SU(3) dark gauge group with $N_f = 6$ flavors, governed by an inverse power-law potential $V(\phi) = \Lambda_{c}^{4+2/3} \phi^{-2/3}$. Unlike $\Lambda$CDM and $w_0w_a$CDM, the dark energy sector contains no free parameters -- the condensation scale $\Lambda_c$ and transition epoch $a_c$ are determined by gauge coupling unification constraints. The equation of state evolves from relativistic behavior ($w = 1/3$) before condensation through a kinetic-dominated stiff phase ($w \simeq 1$), approaching $w_0 = -0.9298 \pm 0.0003$ at present, with $w > -1$ maintained throughout cosmic history, avoiding phantom-regime instabilities. We obtain $\Lambda_{c} = 43.93 \pm 0.13$~eV and $a_c = (2.489 \pm 0.007) \times 10^{-6}$, consistent with theoretical predictions. The $w_0$-$w_a$ confidence contours are approximately 10,000 times smaller than those of $w_0w_a$CDM while achieving comparable fits, and remain stable across different supernova datasets. Statistical analysis yields $\Delta\mathrm{DIC} = -6.77$ and $\Delta\mathrm{AIC} = -8.97$ relative to $\Lambda$CDM for BAO+DESY5, constituting strong evidence favoring BDE-CDM model. The model predicts distinctive signatures including 25\% enhancement in the matter power spectrum at $k \approx 4.3\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. These results establish BDE-CDM as a theoretically motivated framework that successfully addresses the DESI-observed preference for dynamical dark energy while connecting particle physics with cosmological observations.
#### Time delay measurements with Broken Power Law model

 - **Abstract**
 One of the key challenges in strong gravitational lensing cosmography is the accurate measurement of time delays between multiple lensed images, which are essential for constraining the Hubble constant ($H_0$). We investigate how lens mass-profile assumptions affect time delays. Specifically, we implement a Broken Power Law (BPL) mass model within the Lenstronomy framework (Birrer & Amara 2018), which introduces additional flexibility in the radial mass distribution and can phenomenologically capture deviations from a single power-law profile. This model is combined with a numerical approach to compute time delays at the image positions. We validate the BPL implementation using simulated lenses and compare the results with those obtained from the elliptical power-law (EPL) model. We then apply both model families to the quadruply imaged quasar WGD~2038-4008. Both models fit the imaging and kinematic data comparably well, yet the greater radial freedom in the BPL model shifts the inferred time-delay distance -- and thus $H_0$ -- by an amount comparable to the current discrepancy between early- and late-universe $H_0$ estimates. In a flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, the $H_0$ inferred using the BPL lens model is $75^{+23.1}_{-16.3} \ \mathrm{km \ s^{-1} \ Mpc^{-1}},$ while the EPL model gives $H_0 = 61^{+19.2}_{-13.2} \ \mathrm{km \ s^{-1} \ Mpc^{-1}}.$ This difference is largely due to uncertainties in the inner mass profile ($\theta<0.2''$), a region where point spread function (PSF) reconstruction is a critical factor -- a finding consistent with results reported in Shajib et al. (2022). This highlights how time-delay cosmography remains sensitive to assumptions about the lens mass profile. With current precision, this difference does not favor one cosmological scenario over another, but rather underscores the importance of flexible mass modeling and PSF modeling.
#### Collapse versus Disruption: The Fate of Compact Stellar Systems in Ultralight Dark Matter Halos

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09403

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.09403

 - **Abstract**
 Interference of the ultralight dark matter (ULDM) field generates time-varying gravitational potential fluctuations, which stochastically heat stellar systems embedded in ULDM halos. Small-sized stellar systems are therefore often used to set stringent constraints on ULDM. However, the evolution of systems with sizes well below the ULDM de Broglie wavelength remains poorly explored. Using numerical simulations, we show that the evolution of compact stellar systems in ULDM halos is governed by the interplay between internal stellar relaxation and ULDM-induced heating. We find the following main results. First, in sufficiently compact systems, relaxation-driven core collapse dominates, allowing the system to remain bound and dense, while ULDM-induced stripping of outer stars further accelerates the collapse. Second, in more extended systems, ULDM heating dominates and ultimately disrupts the system. Near the disruption threshold, we identify systems resembling ultra-faint dwarfs like Segue 1. Third, we further introduce a dimensionless parameter to quantify the relative importance of heating and relaxation and finally lead to an evolutionary phase diagram. Our results reveal the rich and nontrivial dynamics of compact stellar systems in ULDM halos, indicating that precise system modeling is essential for robust ULDM constraints.
#### Resolving Hubble tension and locating missing baryons: Synergies between fast radio bursts and emerging cosmological probes

 - **Abstract**
 Two of the most pressing challenges in cosmology are the persistent discrepancy in measurements of the Hubble constant, referred to as the Hubble tension, and the deficit of baryons in the local Universe, known as the missing baryon problem. Fast radio bursts (FRBs) encode the integrated electron column density along their lines of sight, offering a unique probe of both the cosmic expansion rate ($H_0$) and the baryon density ($\Omega_{\rm b}$). However, constraints from FRBs alone suffer from a severe $H_0$-$\Omega_{\rm b}$ degeneracy that prevents them from resolving either problem independently. We show that this degeneracy can be broken by combining FRBs with other emerging probes whose degeneracy directions differ in the $H_0$-$\Omega_{\rm b}$ plane. Specifically, we quantify three multi-messenger approaches: FRBs paired with gravitational wave (GW) standard sirens, strong gravitational lensing (SGL) time delays, and 21 cm intensity mapping (IM). The combinations FRB+GW, FRB+SGL, and FRB+21 cm IM each deliver simultaneous constraints on $H_0$ and $\Omega_{\rm b}$ better than ($1\%$, $1\%$) in the $\Lambda$CDM model, ($1.5\%$, $2\%$) in the $w$CDM model, and ($2\%$, $3.5\%$) in the CPL model. Moreover, in a model-independent framework, both FRB+GW and FRB+SGL constrain $H_0$ and $\Omega_{\rm b}$ to better than ($1\%$, $2\%$) precision. These results demonstrate that the synergy between FRBs and other emerging probes holds great promise for resolving the Hubble tension and locating the missing baryons.
#### Using 23 Years of ACS/SBC Data to Understand Backgrounds:Explaining & Predicting Background Variations

 - **Abstract**
 Recent analysis of 23 years of Hubble Space Telescope ACS/SBC data has shown that background levels can vary considerably between observations, with most filters showing over an order of magnitude variation. For the shorter-wavelength filters, the background is understood to be dominated by airglow; however, what precisely drives background variations is not well constrained for any filter. Here, we explore the causes of the background variation. Using over 8,000 archival SBC observations, we developed a machine learning model that can accurately predict the background for an observation, based upon a set of 23 observational parameters. This model indicates that, depending on filter, the SBC background is generally dominated by Solar elevation, Solar separation angle, Earth limb angle of observation, SBC temperature, and target Galactic latitude.
