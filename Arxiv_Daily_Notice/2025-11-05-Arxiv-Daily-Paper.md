 - **Abstract**
 Recent analyses combining cosmic microwave background (CMB) and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) challenge particle physics constraints on the total neutrino mass, pointing to values smaller than the lower limit from neutrino oscillation experiments. To examine the impact of different CMB likelihoods from $\mathit{Planck}$, lensing potential measurements from $\mathit{Planck}$ and ACT, and BAO data from DESI, we introduce an effective neutrino mass parameter ($\sum \tilde{m}_{\nu}$) which is allowed to take negative values. We investigate its correlation with two extra parameters capturing the impact of gravitational lensing on the CMB: one controlling the smoothing of the peaks of the temperature and polarization power spectra; one rescaling the lensing potential amplitude. In this configuration, we infer $\sum \tilde{m}_{\nu}=-0.018^{+0.085}_{-0.089}~\text{eV}~(68\% ~\text{C.L.})$, which is fully consistent with the minimal value required by neutrino oscillation experiments. We attribute the apparent preference for negative neutrino masses to an excess of gravitational lensing detected by late-time cosmological probes compared to that inferred from $\mathit{Planck}$ CMB angular power spectra. We discuss implications in light of the DESI BAO measurements and the CMB lensing anomaly.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a physically motivated extension of the FP for elliptical galaxies, derived from the scalar virial theorem and calibrated using observational data. Starting from the basic equilibrium condition, we incorporate key physical parameters that govern galaxy structure and dynamics, namely stellar mass-to-light ratio, central dark matter fraction, and structural non-homology as traced by the Sersic profile. The resulting model retains the original dependencies on velocity dispersion and surface brightness, but introduces physically interpretable corrections that significantly improve the fit to real data. Using a large galaxy sample, we demonstrate that this extended FP achieves a higher level of accuracy than the classical form, with all parameters showing strong statistical significance. Our results indicate that the observed FP can be understood as an empirical refinement of the virial prediction, once variations in stellar populations, dark matter content, and internal structure are taken into account. This work provides a unified framework that bridges theoretical expectations with observed scaling relations in elliptical systems.

 - **Abstract**
 The distribution of dark matter in the Milky Way (MW) is expected to exhibit a large-scale dynamical response to the recent infall of the LMC. This event produces a dynamical friction wake and shifts the MW's halo density center. The structure of this response encodes information about the LMC- MW mass ratio, the LMC's orbit, the MW halo's pre-infall structure and could provide constraints on dark matter physics. To extract this information, a method to separate these effects and recover the initial shape of the MW's halo is required. Here, we use basis function expansions to analyze the halo response in eighteen simulations of MW-LMC-like interactions from the MWest cosmological, dark-matter-only zoom-in simulations. The results show that mergers similar to the LMC consistently generate a significant dipole and a secondary quadrupole response in the halo. The dipole arises from the host density center displacement and halo distortions, and its amplitude scales as the square of the MW-LMC mass ratio, peaking 0.2-0.7 Gyr after the LMC's pericenter. The quadrupole's strength depends primarily on the original axis ratios of the host halo, though contributions from the dynamical friction wake cause it to peak less than 0.3 Gyr before pericenter. Future measurements of both the dipole and quadrupole imprints of the LMC's passage in the density of the MW's stellar halo should be able to disentangle these effects and provide insight into the initial structure of the MW's halo, the MW's response, and the mass of the LMC.

 - **Abstract**
 The destruction of Giant Molecular Clouds is a key component in galaxy evolution. We theoretically model the destruction of GMCs by HII regions, which evaporate ionized gas and eject neutral gas during their expansion. HII regions follow one of three tracks, depending on the EUV luminosity, $S$, of the ionizing OB association: the expansion can stall inside the cloud; it can break out, forming a blister (champagne) flow; or, for $S>S_{\rm com}$, it can result in the formation of a cometary cloud. We present results for the accumulated mass loss, $M_{\rm loss}(t)$, and the final mass loss, $M_{{\rm loss},f}$, by evaporation and ejection for a range of cloud masses ($10^4<M<10^{7}$ M$_\odot$), cloud surface densities ($50<\Sigma<1000$ M$_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$), OB association luminosities ($10^{44}<S<10^{52}$ s$^{-1}$), and off-center position of the association. We do not consider starbursts; our neglect of radiation pressure restricts our treatment to $S<10^{52} [(M/10^6$ M$_\odot)^{0.3})/(\Sigma /100$ M$_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$)] s$^{-1}$, and our neglect of gravity restricts $(M/10^6$ M$_\odot$)($\Sigma/ 100$ M$_\odot$ pc$^{-2}) < 10$. We find that $M_{{\rm loss},f}$ for the range $0.1 < M_{{\rm loss},f}/M < 0.7$ , is proportional to $S^p$, where $p\sim 0.45-0.75$ depends on $M$, $\Sigma$, and association position. We find analytic fits to $S_{\rm com}$ as a function of $\Sigma$, $M$, and association position. $S> S_{\rm com}$ associations destroy at least 70% of the initial cloud. We find a critical cloud mass $M_{\rm survive}$ above which clouds never become cometary and lose $<$ 70% of their mass via a single association. Low mass clouds mostly lose mass via ejection of neutral gas.

 - **Abstract**
 Be stars are rapidly rotating B-type stars that exhibit Balmer emission lines in their optical spectra. These stars play an important role in studies of stellar evolution and disk structures. In this work, we carried out a systematic search for Be stars based on LAMOST spectroscopic data. Using low-resolution spectra from LAMOST DR11, we constructed a data set and developed a classification model that combines long short-term memory networks and convolutional neural networks , achieving a testing accuracy of 97.86%. The trained model was then applied to spectra with signal-to-noise ratios greater than 10, yielding 55,667 B-type candidates. With the aid of the MKCLASS automated classification tool and manual verification, we finally confirmed 40,223 B-type spectra. By cross-matching with published H{\alpha} emission-line star catalogs, we obtained a sample of 8298 Be stars, including 3787 previously reported Be stars and 4511 newly discovered. Furthermore, by incorporating color information, we classified the Be star sample into Herbig Be stars and Classical Be stars. In total, we identified 3363 Classical Be stars and 35 Herbig Be stars. The B-type and Be star catalogs derived in this study, together with the code used for model training, have been publicly released to facilitate community research.
#### Weak-Lensing Analysis of the Galaxy Cluster Abell 85: Constraints on the Merger Scenarios of Its Southern Subcluster

 - **Abstract**
 Abell 85 is a nearby (z=0.055) galaxy cluster that hosts a sloshing cool core, a feature commonly reported in relaxed clusters. However, the presence of multiple past and ongoing mergers indicates that it is an active node within the Abell 85/87/89 complex. We present a weak gravitational lensing (WL) analysis using Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam imaging data to understand its assembly history by investigating the dark matter components of the substructures. Our mass reconstruction resolves three substructures associated with the brightest cluster galaxy (main), the southern (S) subcluster, and the southwestern (SW) subcluster, with WL peak significances of $> 6\sigma$, $> 5\sigma$, and $> 4\sigma$, respectively. The locations of these mass peaks are consistent with those of the member galaxies. We estimate the masses of the main cluster ($M_{200c,main} = 2.91 \pm 0.72 \times 10^{14}\ M_\odot$) and the S subcluster ($M_{200c,S} = 1.23 \pm 0.52 \times 10^{14}\ M_\odot$) by fitting a multi-halo Navarro-Frenk-White profile. This $\sim$2:1 mass ratio indicates that the system is undergoing a major merger that is actively shaping the current dynamical state of Abell 85. Incorporating X-ray observations, we discuss the merger phase of the S subcluster and further examine the star-forming activity along the putative filament extending southeast of Abell 85.

 - **Abstract**
 In the solution of the Jeans equations for axisymmetric galaxy models the ``$b$-ansatz" is often adopted to prescribe the relation between the vertical and radial components of the velocity dispersion tensor, and close the equations. However, $b$ affects the resulting azimuthal velocity fields quite indirectly, so that the analysis of the model kinematics is usually performed after numerically solving the Jeans equations, a time consuming approach. In a previous work we presented a general method to determine the main properties of the kinematical fields resulting in the $b$-ansatz framework before solving the Jeans equations; results were illustrated by means of disk galaxy models. In this paper we focus more specifically on realistic ellipsoidal galaxy models. It is found that how and where $b$ affects the galaxy kinematical fields is mainly dependent on the flattening of the stellar density distribution, moderately on the presence of a Dark Matter halo, and much less on the specific galaxy density profile. The main trends revealed by the numerical exploration, in particular the fact that more flattened systems can support larger $b$-anisotropy, are explained with the aid of simple ellipsoidal galaxy models, for which most of the analysis can be conducted analytically. The obtained results can be adopted as guidelines for model building and in the interpretation of observational data.
#### Supernova Classification using the Recurrent Neural Network in the CSST Ultra-Deep Field Survey

 - **Abstract**
 We study supernova (SN) classification using the machine learning method of the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) in the Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope Ultra-Deep Field (CSST-UDF) photometric survey, and explore the improvement of the cosmological constraint. We generate the mock light curve data of Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) and core collapse supernova (CCSN) using SNCosmo with SALT3 SN Ia model and CCSN templates, and apply the SuperNNova (SNN) program for classifying SNe. Our study indicates that the SNN combined with the Joint Light-curve Analysis like (JLA-like) cuts can enhance the purity of the CSST-UDF SN Ia sample up to over 99.5% with 2,193 SNe Ia and 4 CCSNe, which can significantly increase the reliability of the cosmological constraint results. The method based on the Bayesian Estimation Applied to Multiple Species (BEAMS) with Bias Corrections (BBC) framework is used to correct the SN Ia magnitude bias caused by the selection effect and CCSN contamination, and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is employed for cosmological constraints. We find that the accuracy of the constraints on the matter density $\Omega_{\rm M}$ and the equation of state of dark energy $w$ can achieve 14% and 18%, respectively, assuming the flat $w$CDM model. This result is comparable to that from the current surveys that relied on spectroscopic confirmation. It indicates that our data analysis method is effective, and the CSST-UDF SN photometric survey is powerful in exploring the expansion history of the Universe.
#### The effect of mass and morphology on the mass assembly of galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 The pace at which galaxies grew into their current stellar masses and how this growth is regulated is still not fully understood, nor is the role that morphology plays in this process. We applied full spectral fitting techniques with pyPipe3D to the MaNGA sample to obtain its star formation and stellar mass histories and used these to investigate the mass assembly of galaxies by measuring how their specific star formation correlates to their stellar mass at different look-back times. We find that the correlation between these two parameters was shallower in the past. Galaxies used to have similar mass doubling times and the current negative correlation between the specific star formation and M* is primarily due to more massive galaxies 'dropping' off the main sequence earlier than less massive ones. Additionally, selecting the galaxies into bins based on their present-day morphology shows a segregation in specific star formation rate (sSFR) that is maintained even at high look-back times, showing that the factors that determine which morphology a galaxy ends up in are in place at very early times. Similarly, selecting them based on their current star formation status shows that, on average, currently retired galaxies used to have slightly a higher sSFR before the drop-off, whereas galaxies that have continued to form stars until today had a lower sSFR initially. We compare our results to a set of cosmic surveys, finding partial agreement in our results with several of them, though with significant offsets in redshift. Finally, we discuss how our results fit with certain theoretical models on galaxy evolution as well as cosmological simulations.
#### Searching Within Galaxies for the Earliest Signs of Quenching With Spatially Resolved Star Formation Histories in UVCANDELS

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the complicated processes that regulate star formation and cause a galaxy to become quiescent is key to our comprehension of galaxy evolution. We used nine well resolved star-forming z<1 galaxies from the UVCANDELS survey, where a total of 10 HST bands including UV follow up in UVIS/F275W allow us to reconstruct the star formation histories (SFHs) of regions across each galaxy. This approach provides a powerful tool to explore the spatio-temporal connection between star formation and galaxy evolution. The spatial and temporal profiles of stellar mass and star formation rate surface density were obtained from the SFHs of these regions. We measure scaling relations and projected radial profiles of regions within each galaxy at the time of observation and at 1 Gyr lookback time, noting possible trends in the evolution. By comparing the change in star formation over time we can infer the timing and location of star formation and see early signs of star formation shut off before quenching occurs. We compared the star formation rate density -- stellar mass density scaling relations for individual galaxies as they evolve from 1 Gyr lookback time. The correlation lines pivot around a log-stellar mass surface density of 7.25 [$M_\odot$ $kpc^{-2}$] may be evidence of a self-regulating process on these scales. Radial profiles of galaxy Log sSFR show an overall decrease over 1 Gyr, but five galaxies show a greater change in Log sSFR at the outskirts than the center indicating a possible early onset of quenching in these galaxies.
