 - **Abstract**
 We study the cosmology of axions in the post-inflationary scenario, where random initial conditions and the ensuing string-domain-wall network generate an isocurvature power spectrum. Axions radiated from strings behave as warm, wave-like dark matter: when they constitute the full dark matter abundance, free streaming sets the strongest bounds on their mass. For subdominant fractions, despite being warm, they still lead to an overall enhancement of structure growth in the dominant component, seeded by the axion white-noise fluctuations. We search for this effect using the ultraviolet luminosity function (UVLF) of galaxies at $z=4$-$10$, probing $k\simeq0.5$-$10\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. Combining the UVLF analysis with Lyman-$\alpha$ and CMB data yields the leading cosmological limits on post-inflationary axion dark matter, sensitive to tiny fractions for $m_a\lesssim10^{-21}\,\mathrm{eV}$. As a byproduct, we obtain new constraints on generic white-noise power spectra from the UVLF. These results apply broadly to scenarios that generate similar isocurvature perturbations, linking early-universe field dynamics to high-redshift structure formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Upcoming measurements of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect, which results from Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons scattering off moving electrons, offer a powerful probe of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). The kSZ signal contains key information about the timing, duration, and spatial structure of the EoR. A precise measurement of the CMB optical depth $\tau$, a key parameter that characterizes the universe's integrated electron density, would significantly constrain models of early structure formation. However, the weak kSZ signal is difficult to extract from CMB observations due to significant contamination from astrophysical foregrounds. We present a machine learning approach to extract $\tau$ from simulated kSZ maps. We train advanced machine learning models, including swin transformers, on high-resolution seminumeric simulations of the kSZ signal. To robustly quantify prediction uncertainties of $\tau$, we employ the Laplace Approximation (LA). This approach provides an efficient and principled Gaussian approximation to the posterior distribution over the model's weights, allowing for reliable error estimation. We investigate and compare two distinct application modes: a post-hoc LA applied to a pre-trained model, and an online LA where model weights and hyperparameters are optimized jointly by maximizing the marginal likelihood. This approach provides a framework for robustly constraining $\tau$ and its associated uncertainty, which can enhance the analysis of upcoming CMB surveys like the Simons Observatory and CMB-S4.
#### Blind Strong Gravitational Lensing Inversion: Joint Inference of Source and Lens Mass with Score-Based Models
 - **Authors:** Gabriel Missael Barco, Ronan Legin, Connor Stone, Yashar Hezaveh, Laurence Perreault-Levasseur
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Machine Learning (cs.LG)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04792

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04792

 - **Abstract**
 Score-based models can serve as expressive, data-driven priors for scientific inverse problems. In strong gravitational lensing, they enable posterior inference of a background galaxy from its distorted, multiply-imaged observation. Previous work, however, assumes that the lens mass distribution (and thus the forward operator) is known. We relax this assumption by jointly inferring the source and a parametric lens-mass profile, using a sampler based on GibbsDDRM but operating in continuous time. The resulting reconstructions yield residuals consistent with the observational noise, and the marginal posteriors of the lens parameters recover true values without systematic bias. To our knowledge, this is the first successful demonstration of joint source-and-lens inference with a score-based prior.
#### Using ML-based Regression Techniques to Mitigate GOES Energetic Proton Flux Data Contamination and Magnetospheric Effects
 - **Authors:** Aatiya Ali, Viacheslav Sadykov

Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04821

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04821

 - **Abstract**
 Positioned at geostationary orbit (GEO) ~36,000 km above Earth, NOAA's GOES series has recorded real-time energetic proton flux measurements crucial for space weather monitoring for over three decades. Although machine learning models have advanced solar energetic particle (SEP) event prediction using GOES data, the sudden yet sparse nature of SEP events necessitates high-quality proton flux measurements. Previous studies have identified contamination issues in GOES data, when the presence of higher-energy protons can cause parasitic signals in lower-energy GOES channels and lead to artificially elevated fluxes in lower energy ranges (e.g., 10 - 50 MeV). As of now, no universal correction method has been implemented for the publicly available NOAA data. In addition, the effects of Earth's magnetosphere on the 10 - 50 MeV particles are not fully understood yet. This study assesses a reconstruction method using concurrent solar proton event (SPE) measurements from SOHO-EPHIN, which align well with GOES measurements of SPEs across solar cycles 23 and the bulk of cycle 24, but represent the off-magnetospheric environment of the Lagrange 1 point. We train regression models on GOES proton fluxes across multiple energy bins, employing EPHIN fluxes as prediction targets. We expect that similar approaches can allow us to derive non-contaminated flux proxies that preserve valuable data and more accurately capture the characteristics of SPEs, providing a more stable dataset for analyzing SEP behavior and potentially improving SEP event prediction models.
#### Sym-EFT: Accelerating Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structure with Symbolic Regression
 - **Authors:** Despoina Farakou, Constantinos Skordis

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05093

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.05093

 - **Abstract**
 We present an emulator suite for the one- and two-loop cold dark matter power spectrum from the Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structures (EFTofLSS). Specifically, we emulate separately the various contributions to the one- and two-loop parts of the power spectrum, leaving out the possible counterterms which can be added as multiplicative prefactors. By leaving the time-dependence of the counterterms unspecified at the emulation stage, our technique has the advantage of being extremely versatile in fitting any type of counterterm parametrisation to data, or to simulations, without having to change the emulator. We construct our emulators using the method of symbolic regression which results in functions that can be used directly in computer code, while achieving errors of better than $0.5\%$ within the $k$-range of validity of EFT and maintaining ultra-fast computational evaluation of less than $\sim5\times10^{-4}s$ on a single core.
#### Spatially-resolved PAH_3.3 emission and stellar ages in ram pressure stripped clumps at z~0.3

 - **Abstract**
 Ram pressure stripping (RPS) plays a crucial role in shaping galaxy evolution in dense environments, yet its impact on the molecular and dusty phases of the interstellar medium remains poorly understood. We present JWST/NIRCam 3.3 micrometres PAH emission maps for the nine most striking RPS galaxies in the Abell 2744 cluster at redshift z_cl = 0.306, tracing the effects of environmental processes on small dust grains. Exploiting multi-band JWST/NIRCam and HST photometry, we perform spatially-resolved UV to mid-infrared spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, characterising stellar populations in both galactic disks and clumps detected in the stripped tails. We detect PAH_3.3 mission in eight of the nine galaxies at 5 sigma, with morphologies revealing disk truncation and elongation along the RPS direction. In three galaxies, PAH_3.3 emission is also found in star-forming clumps embedded in the stripped tails up to a distance of 40 kpc. Star formation rates inferred from PAH_3.3 emission agree with those derived from SED fitting averaged over the past 100 Myr within an intrinsic scatter of 0.4 dex, but the relation appears to be age dependent. The spatial correlation between PAH strength, stellar age, and SFR - consistent across disks and tails - demonstrates that PAH-carrying molecules can survive and be stripped by ram pressure. Finally, age gradients revealed by the SED fitting provide the first observational evidence outside the Local Universe for the fireball model of star formation in stripped clumps. This work represents the first detailed study of PAH emission in cluster galaxies, offering new insights into the fate of dust and star formation in extreme environments.

 - **Abstract**
 The papers included in this Focus Point collection are devoted to the studies on the cosmological tensions and challenges stimulated by the latest observational data. The first results of the LARES-2 laser ranging satellite on the high precision testing of the frame-dragging effect predicted by General Relativity are presented. The data on the S-stars monitoring in the Galactic center obtained by GRAVITY collaboration were analysed within the Physics-informed neural network (PINN) approach. The results enabled to probe the role of the cosmological constant, of the dark matter, the star cluster in the core of the Galaxy obtaining an upper limit for the star density. The topics include the conversion of high-frequency relic gravitational waves into photons in cosmological magnetic field, cosmological gravitational waves stochastic background generation through the spontaneous breaking of a global baryon number symmetry, observational predictions of the Starobinsky inflation model and other studies.

 - **Abstract**
 Dark matter (DM) halos form hierarchically in the Universe through a series of merger events. Cosmological simulations can represent this series of mergers as a graph-like ``tree'' structure. Previous work has shown these merger trees are sensitive to cosmology simulation parameters, but as DM structures, the outstanding question of their sensitivity to DM models remains unanswered. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of deep learning methods trained on merger trees to infer Warm Dark Matter (WDM) particles masses from the DREAMS simulation suite. We organize the merger trees from 1,024 zoom-in simulations into graphs with nodes representing the merger history of galaxies and edges denoting hereditary links. We vary the complexity of the node features included in the graphs ranging from a single node feature up through an array of several galactic properties (e.g., halo mass, star formation rate, etc.). We train a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to predict the WDM mass using the graph representation of the merger tree as input. We find that the GNN can predict the mass of the WDM particle ($R^2$ from 0.07 to 0.95), with success depending on the graph complexity and node features. We extend the same methods to supernovae and active galactic nuclei feedback parameters $A_\text{SN1}$, $A_\text{SN2}$, and $A_\text{AGN}$, successfully inferring the supernovae parameters. The GNN can even infer the WDM mass from merger tree histories without any node features, indicating that the structure of merger trees alone inherits information about the cosmological parameters of the simulations from which they form.
#### Investigating the imprints of tidal features on simulated galaxy outskirts in LSST-like mock observations

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal features provide signatures of recent galaxy mergers, offering insights into the role of mergers in galaxy evolution. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory's upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will allow for an unprecedented study of tidal features around millions of galaxies. We use mock images of galaxies at $z\sim0$ ($z\sim0.2$ for \textsc{NewHorizon}) from \textsc{NewHorizon}, \textsc{eagle}, \textsc{IllustrisTNG}, and \textsc{Magneticum Pathfinder} simulations to predict the properties of tidal features in LSST-like images. We find that tidal features are more prevalent around blue galaxies with intrinsic colours $(g-i)\leq0.5$, compared to redder ones, at fixed stellar mass. This trend correlates with elevated specific star formation rates ($\mathrm{sSFR}>10^{-10}\mathrm{\:yr}^{-1}$), suggesting that merger-induced star formation contributes to the bluer colours. Tidal feature hosts in the red sequence appear to exhibit colour profiles offset to bluer colours for galaxies with stellar masses $10^{10}<M_{\star\mathrm{,\:30\:pkpc}}/\mathrm{M}_\odot<10^{11}$, similarly blue cloud tidal feature host galaxies appear to have their colour profiles offset to bluer colours for $10^{9.5}<M_{\star\mathrm{,\:30\:pkpc}}/\mathrm{M}_\odot<10^{10.5}$. However, the differences in colour profiles in either the red sequence or the blue cloud are not statistically robust and larger samples are needed to test if these differences are real. The predictions across the simulations are quantitatively distinct; therefore, LSST observations will allow us to further constrain the differences between different subgrid physics models.
#### Non-Gaussian Galaxy Stochasticity and the Noise-Field Formulation

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.05484

 - **Abstract**
 We revisit the stochastic, or noise, contributions to the galaxy density field within the effective field theory (EFT) of large-scale structure. Starting from the general, all-order expression of the EFT partition function, we elucidate how the stochastic contributions can be described by local nonlinear couplings of a single Gaussian noise field. We introduce an alternative formulation of the partition function in terms of such a noise field, and derive the corresponding field-level likelihood for biased tracers. This noise-field formulation can capture the complete set of stochastic contributions to the galaxy density at the field level in a normalized, positive-definite probability density which is suitable for numerical sampling. We illustrate this by presenting the first results of EFT-based field-level inference with non-Gaussian and density-dependent stochasticity on dark matter halos using LEFTfield.
