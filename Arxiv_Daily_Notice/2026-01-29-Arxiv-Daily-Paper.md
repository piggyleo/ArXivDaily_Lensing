 - **Abstract**
 We report the measurement of the R3=[O III]5008/Hb ratios for 54 galaxies in the GLIMPSE-D survey. Thanks to gravitational lensing, our sample includes galaxies with -20 < Muv < -14 at z=6-9. We derive oxygen abundances using calibrated relationships. We observe a significant decline in R3 values below Muv > -18, which we interpret as evidence of decreasing metallicities in fainter regimes. We explore four prescription models of the evolution of R3 with UV emission based on the new measurements and results from previous surveys. Applying these models to the GLIMPSE [O III]+Hb luminosity functions, we measure and extrapolate the ionising photon production rate $\dot{N}_{ion}$ of galaxies down to very faint limits SFR(Ha) > 5e-3 Msun/yr. Our results support the dominant contribution of star-forming galaxies to reionisation, and are consistent with the recent discovery of ultra-faint metal-poor galaxies. Our measurements of the relative contribution of each luminosity bin show that galaxies with L(Ha)~1e41 to 1e42 erg/s dominate at 8<z<9, but the relative contributions become more uniform at $7<z<8$. Extreme models either under- or over-estimate the ionising photon budget, while intermediate models align with recent observational constraints.

 - **Abstract**
 As observations have yet to constrain the ionizing properties of the faintest (M$_{\rm UV}$ > -16) galaxies, their contribution to cosmic reionization remains unclear. The rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) continuum slope ($\beta$) is a powerful diagnostic of stellar populations and one of the few feasible indicators of the escape fraction of ionizing photons (f$_{\rm esc}$) for such faint galaxies at high-redshift. Leveraging ultra-deep JWST/NIRCam GLIMPSE imaging of strong lensing field Abell S1063, we estimate UV continuum slopes of 555 galaxies at z $>$ 6 with absolute magnitudes down to M$_{\rm UV}$ $\simeq -$12.5. We find a modest evolution of $\beta$ with redshift and a flattening in the $\beta$-M$_{\rm UV}$ relation such that galaxies fainter than M$_{\rm UV}$ $\sim -$16.5 no longer exhibit the bluest UV slopes. The 138 ultra-faint galaxies with M$_{\rm UV}$ $> -$16 are a diverse population encompassing dusty (30\%), old (15\%), and low-mass (50\%) galaxies. We apply the empirical $\beta$-f$_{\rm esc}$ relation from local Lyman continuum leakers, finding the mean f$_{\rm esc}$ peaks at $\sim 20\%$ at M$_{\rm UV}=-$16.5 and declines towards fainter galaxies, while remaining consistent with f$_{\rm esc}$ = 14\% within uncertainties, in agreement with recent radiative transfer simulations. Incorporating GLIMPSE constraints on the UV luminosity function, ionizing photon production efficiency, and escape fractions produces a reionization history consistent with independent observational constraints. Our results indicate galaxies with M$_{\rm UV}$ between $-18$ and $-14$ supplied $\sim 60\%$ of the ionizing photons to cosmic reionization, while the lower f$_{\rm esc}$ of fainter galaxies produces a natural cutoff in the ionizing photon production rate density.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra-faint galaxies at high-$z$ are fundamental elements of the early galaxy assembly, and spectroscopic characterization of this population is essential to understand the earliest galaxy evolution. Leveraging the ultra-deep JWST/NIRCam and NIRSpec observations of a gravitational lensing field of Abell S1063, taken as part of the GLIMPSE survey, we present spectroscopic properties of 16 galaxies fainter than $M_{\rm UV}=-17$ mag, including the metallicity, dust attenuation, and the ionizing photon production efficiency. The emission lines are generally quite strong, roughly half of which cannot be replicated with standard stellar populations and require an extreme ionizing source. We also identify relatively strong [OIII] emission lines from all sample galaxies, which indicates that the low-mass end of the mass-metallicity relation is extended down to $M_\star\sim10^6\ M_\odot$ at $z\sim6$. The strong [OIII] line detection from the lowest-mass galaxy among the sample ($M_\star\sim10^{5.6}\ M_\odot$) stands in contrast to recent reports of extremely metal-poor galaxy candidates at similar mass and redshift, suggesting that there could be two distinct pathways of the earliest metal enrichment as simulations have predicted. Interestingly, we detect both dust attenuation and galactic outflow in one of the sample galaxies with $M_\star=10^{6.6}\ M_\odot$ at $z=5.5$. All the dust, metal, and outflow contents in this galaxy can be consistently explained by supernovae (SNe), indicative of the key roles of SNe in the earliest galaxy assembly such as dust production, metal enrichment, stellar feedback, and baryon cycle.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the climates of terrestrial exoplanets and the detectability of biosignatures is an inherently interdisciplinary challenge, requiring the integration of insights from Solar System exploration, exoplanet observations and climate science. Building from Earth as the only known inhabited planet, NCCR PlanetS has developed models, tools and observational strategies to assess planetary environments far beyond direct reach. Between 2018 and 2025, PlanetS made major contributions across theory, modelling, instrumentation and mission preparation. On the modelling side, the Generic Planetary Climate Model enabled climate studies across a wide range of planetary regimes, from early Venus to temperate terrestrial exoplanets including Proxima b, incorporating advanced developments such as a dynamical slab ocean. In parallel, the THOR global climate model was developed to avoid Earth-centric assumptions and to stably simulate diverse atmospheric regimes. PlanetS has also advanced atmospheric retrieval techniques combining forward modelling, Bayesian inference and machine learning, applied to targets ranging from Solar System bodies to exoplanet phase curves and directly imaged spectra. These efforts have helped assess the scientific return of future missions, notably the Large Interferometer for Exoplanets (LIFE) and to define instrumental requirements for detecting Earth-like atmospheres and biosignatures. Within the Solar System, PlanetS contributed key technologies for biosignature detection, including ORIGIN and SenseLife, enabling in-situ and remote detection of organics, isotopic ratios and microstructures. Finally, PlanetS has played a major role in preparing the next generation of observatories, from JWST, VLT and ELT instruments to LIFE and the Habitable Worlds Observatory. Together, these contributions form an integrated framework advancing the search for life beyond Earth.
#### How well is the local Large Scale Structure of the Universe known? CosmicFlows vs. Biteau's Galaxy Catalog with Cloning

 - **Abstract**
 Knowledge of the actual density distribution of matter in the local universe is needed for a variety of purposes -- for instance, as a baseline model for ultrahigh energy cosmic ray sources in the continuum limit and for predicting the diffuse Dark Matter annihilation signal. Determining the local mass density and velocity distribution is the aim of the CosmicFlows project. An alternate approach is based on catalogs of galaxies, supplemented with some scheme for filling in for unseen galaxies. Here, we compare the density field proposed by Biteau (2021) with the quasi-linear density field of CosmicFlows2 (Hoffman et al. 2018) and the mean posterior field of CosmicFlows4 (Valade 2026). We find factor-two level differences in some regions and even greater in regions toward the Galactic center zone of avoidance (ZoA) (|l| < 30°, |b| < 20°) as filled by Biteau using "cloning". Within 11 Mpc the density field is well-determined by the Local Volume catalog (Karachentsev et al. 2018) which Biteau directly incorporates; at larger distances, Biteau (2021) should not be used in the ZoA where "galaxies" are entirely fictitious but otherwise is to be preferred over CosmicFlows emphasizing the direction and integrated mass of structures; the radial distribution of mass in Biteau (2021) is less robust due to line-of-sight peculiar velocities. The angular positions of structures in CosmicFlows are sometimes not congruent with evidence in the galaxy catalog.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate modelling of redshift-space distortions (RSD) is essential for maximizing the cosmological information extracted from large galaxy redshift surveys. In preparation for the forthcoming analysis of the Euclid spectroscopic data, we investigate three approaches to modelling RSD effects on the power spectrum multipoles of mock H$\alpha$ emission line galaxies. We focus on two one-loop perturbation theory models -- the effective field theory (EFT) and velocity difference generator (${\rm VDG_ \infty}$) -- which differ in their treatment of the real-to-redshift space mapping on small scales, and a third approach, the BACCO emulator, which adopts a hybrid strategy combining perturbation theory with high-resolution N-body simulations. We assess the ability of these models to recover key cosmological parameters, including the expansion rate $h$, the cold dark matter density parameter $\omega_{\rm c}$, and the scalar amplitude $A_{\rm s}$, across four redshift bins spanning $0.9 \leq z \leq 1.8$. In each bin, we find that ${\rm VDG_ \infty}$ and BACCO outperform the EFT model across all scales up to $k_{max} \lesssim 0.35 h\,Mpc^{-1} $. While BACCO saturates in constraining power at intermediate scales and higher redshift, the ${\rm VDG_ \infty}$ model continues to improve parameter constraints beyond $k_{max} \gtrsim 0.30 h\,Mpc^{-1}$. The EFT model, although robust on large scales, exhibits significant parameter biases for $k_{max} \gtrsim 0.25 h\,Mpc^{-1}$, limiting its applicability to Euclid-like H$\alpha$ samples. Among the full perturbation theory-based models, the enhanced treatment of small-scale RSD effects in ${\rm VDG_ \infty}$ improves cosmological parameter constraints by up to a factor of two.
