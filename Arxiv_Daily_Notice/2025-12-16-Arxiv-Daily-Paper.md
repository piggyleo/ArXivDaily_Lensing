 - **Abstract**
 We quantify departures from hydrodynamical and centrifugal equilibrium in the gas discs of low-mass ($10^{10.75}<M_\mathrm{200c}/\mathrm{M}_\odot<10^{11}$) galaxies from the COLIBRE cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. We evaluate the full Eulerian acceleration balance in the midplane and show that disequilibrium is widespread: equilibrium-based circular velocity estimates typically have errors of $\geq 10$ per cent ($\approx 75$ per cent of midplane gas by mass). Disequilibrium is strongest and the largest associated errors occur in the inner few kiloparsecs that are crucial for constraining the dark matter density profile. Correcting the circular velocity to account for pressure and convective terms does not reliably improve its recovery in strongly perturbed systems where time-dependent forces dominate the residual acceleration budget. Stellar feedback, self-gravitating gas clumps and AGN energy injection account for most strong local perturbations, and large-scale gravitational asymmetries act as a scaffold for disequilibrium. We classify gas discs into coherent, perturbed, and slow/erratic rotators and show that this classification correlates with galaxy properties like mass, morphology and tracers of recent feedback. A majority of galaxies in our sample would be unsuitable for standard rotation curve analysis. Much of the observed diversity in the shapes of dwarf galaxy rotation curves may stem from non-equilibrium gas motions rather than diversity in mass profiles - resolving the discrepancy is then first and foremost a problem in gas dynamics.
#### An Open Benchmark of One Million High-Fidelity Cislunar Trajectories

 - **Abstract**
 Cislunar space spans from geosynchronous altitudes to beyond the Moon and will underpin future exploration, science, and security operations. We describe and release an open dataset of one million numerically propagated cislunar trajectories generated with the open-source Space Situational Awareness Python package (SSAPy). The model includes high-degree Earth/Moon gravity, solar gravity, and Earth/Sun radiation pressure; other planetary gravities are omitted by design for computational efficiency. Initial conditions uniformly sample commonly used osculating-element ranges, and each trajectory is propagated for up to six years under a single, fixed start epoch. The dataset is intended as a reusable benchmark for method development (e.g., space domain awareness, navigation, and machine learning pipelines), a reference library for statistical studies of orbit families, and a starting point for community-driven extensions (e.g., alternative epochs). We report empirically observed stability trends (e.g., a band near 5 GEO and persistence of some co-orbital classes including L4/L5 librators) as dataset descriptors rather than new dynamical results. The chief contribution is the scale, fidelity, organization (CSV/HDF5 with full state time series and metadata), and open availability, which together lower the barrier to comparative and data-driven studies in the cislunar regime.

 - **Abstract**
 In the exascale computing era, handling and analyzing massive datasets have become extremely challenging. In situ analysis, which processes data during simulation runtime and bypasses costly intermediate I/O steps, offers a promising solution. We present libyt (this https URL), an open-source C library that enables astrophysical simulations to analyze and visualize data in parallel computation with yt or other Python packages. libyt can invoke Python routines automatically or provide interactive entry points via a Python prompt or a Jupyter Notebook. It requires minimal intervention in researchers' workflow, allowing users to reuse job submission scripts and Python routines. We describe libyt's architecture for parallel computing in high-performance computing environments, including its bidirectional connection between simulation codes and Python, and its integration into the Jupyter ecosystem. We detail its methods for reading AMR simulations and handling in-memory data with minimal overhead, and procedures for yielding data when requested by Python. We describe how libyt maps simulation data to yt frontends, allowing post-processing scripts to be converted into in situ analysis with just two lines of change. We document libyt's API and demonstrate its integration into two astrophysical simulation codes, GAMER and Enzo, using examples including core-collapse supernovae, isolated dwarf galaxies, fuzzy dark matter, the Sod shock tube test, Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, and the AGORA galaxy simulation. Finally, we discuss libyt's performance, limitations related to data redistribution, extensibility, architecture, and comparisons with traditional post-processing approaches.

 - **Abstract**
 Parker Solar Probe (PSP) observes abundant circularly polarized ion-scale waves throughout the inner heliosphere. These waves are a signature of the interplay between plasma microinstabilities and turbulent dissipation. We perform a mission-wide statistical survey of ion-scale waves observed by PSP, investigating if the waves correspond to specific free energy sources in the measured proton velocity distributions. We find that left-handed waves (LHWs) are frequently observed, with the fraction of time they are observed increasing closer to the Sun, reaching $\sim$30\%. Right-handed waves (RHWs) are less frequently observed, with the associated time fraction decreasing closer to the Sun. The observed LHWs are generally consistent with parallel propagating ion cyclotron wave (ICW) storms that occur continuously for extended periods of time. Turbulent energy spectra are consistently steeper when LHW storms are observed; these wave storms mediate the spatial transport of the free energy associated with temperature anisotropy. The observed RHWs are generally consistent with oblique and parallel fast magnetosonic waves (FMWs), and their observation is well correlated with enhanced proton parallel heat flux, which quantifies the presence of secondary proton populations. Using observations and the SAVIC machine learning instability identification algorithm, we identify a threshold on the proton heat flux beyond which FMWs are likely to be driven unstable by the proton beams. We are thus able to associate trends in the observed ion-scale waves with known sources of free energy for Encounters 3 through 24 of the PSP's prime science phase.
#### The magnitude of the dark ages 21-cm signal in the context of existing early and late time constraints on $Λ$CDM

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11568

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.11568

 - **Abstract**
 The dark ages 21-cm signal is a promising probe of the currently unobserved infant universe between the formation of the Cosmic Microwave Background around $z \approx 1100$ and the first galaxies around $z\approx 30$. A detection of the signal will help researchers understanding the nature of dark matter and dark energy, the expansion of the universe and any extensions to the concordance $\Lambda$CDM model that could explain the reported Cosmic Dawn 21-cm signal from EDGES and the Hubble tension. In this letter we take existing constraints on the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model from two early time probes, Planck and WMAP, and two late time probes, DES galaxy lensing and clustering and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, and propagate these through to constraints on the magnitude of the dark ages 21-cm signal. We constrain the magnitude and central frequency of the signal while methodically accounting for uncertainties in the cosmological parameters. We find that within the context of our modelling assumptions and the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, the depth of the dark ages 21-cm signal is known to better than 1 mK and the central frequency to within 0.05 MHz.

 - **Abstract**
 Interacting Dark Energy (IDE) models offer a promising avenue to explore possible exchanges of energy and momentum between dark matter and dark energy, providing a dynamical extension of the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. Such interactions modify the growth of cosmic structures, imprinting distinctive signatures on the matter power spectrum that can be tested through large-scale structure (LSS) observations. In this work, we compute the one-loop corrections to the matter power spectrum in IDE models. We then reinterpret these results within the standard framework of the Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure (EFTofLSS), which provides a consistent description of mildly non-linear scales and allows for reliable comparisons with observational data. We investigate two commonly studied forms of the coupling function, $Q$, namely $Q = \xi \mathcal{H} \rho_{\rm m}$ and $Q = \xi \mathcal{H} \rho_{\rm DE}$, and introduce a novel interaction term, $Q = \Gamma \, \rho_{\rm m} \, \rho_{\rm DE} \, \theta_{\rm m}$, characterized by the non-linear coupling constant $\Gamma$, which links the interaction strength to the velocity divergence of dark matter. This coupling function is proposed to isolate the effects solely of the IDE model on mildly non-linear scales. Using Full-Shape (FS) measurements of the galaxy power spectrum from BOSS DR12, we constrain the interaction rate $\Gamma$, the cosmological parameters, and the bias parameters. We find $\Gamma = 0.0039 \pm 0.0082$, which is highly consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM model. This work opens the possibility of testing IDE models at mildly non-linear scales, potentially providing new insights for this class of models beyond the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework.
#### Solving the Cosmological Vlasov-Poisson Equations with Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks

 - **Abstract**
 Cold dark matter (CDM) evolves as a collisionless fluid under the Vlasov-Poisson equations, but N-body simulations approximate this evolution by discretising the distribution function into particles, introducing discreteness effects at small scales. We present a physics-informed neural network approach that evolves CDM fields without any use of N-body data or methods, using a Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) to model the continuous displacement field for one-dimensional halo collapse. Physical constraints derived from the Vlasov-Poisson equations are embedded directly into the loss function, enabling accurate evolution beyond the first shell crossing. The trained model achieves sub-percent errors on the residuals even after seven shell crossings and matches N-body results while providing a resolution-free representation of the displacement field. In addition, displacement errors do not grow over time, a very interesting feature with respect to N-body methods. It can also reconstruct initial conditions through backward evolution when sufficient final-state information is available. Although current runtimes exceed those of N-body methods, this framework offers a new route to high-fidelity CDM evolution without particle discretisation, with prospects for extension to higher dimensions.
