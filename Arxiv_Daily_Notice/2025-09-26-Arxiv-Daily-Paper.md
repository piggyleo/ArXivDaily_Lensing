 - **Abstract**
 We present the most precise and lowest-mass weak lensing measurements of dwarf galaxies to date, enabled by spectroscopic lenses from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and photometric lenses from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) calibrated with DESI redshifts. Using DESI spectroscopy from the first data release, we construct clean samples of galaxies with median stellar masses $\log_{10}(M_*/M_{\odot})=8.3-10.1$ and measure their weak lensing signals with sources from DES, KiDS, and SDSS, achieving detections with $S/N$ up to 14 for dwarf galaxies ($\log_{10}(M_*/M_{\odot})<$9.25) -- opening up a new regime for lensing measurements of low-mass systems. Leveraging DES photometry calibrated with DESI, we extend to a photometric dwarf sample of over 700,000 galaxies, enabling robust lensing detections of dwarf galaxies with combined $S/N=38$ and a significant measurement down to $\log_{10}(M_*/M_{\odot})=8.0$. We show that the one-halo regime (scales $\lesssim 0.15h^{-1}\rm Mpc$) is insensitive to various systematic and sample selection effects, providing robust halo mass estimates, while the signal in the two-halo regime depends on galaxy color and environment. These results demonstrate that DESI already enables precise dwarf lensing measurements, and that calibrated photometric samples extend this capability. Together, they pave the way for novel constraints on dwarf galaxy formation and dark matter physics with upcoming surveys like the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's LSST.

 - **Abstract**
 Weak gravitational lensing is a powerful probe of cosmology, with second-order shear statistics commonly used to constrain parameters such as the matter density $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ and the clustering amplitude $S_8$. However, parameter degeneracies remain and can be reduced by including higher-order statistics such as the third-order aperture mass. To jointly analyse second- and third-order statistics, an accurate model of their cross-covariance is essential. We derive and validate a non-tomographic analytical model for the cross-covariance between second- and third-order aperture mass statistics. Analytical models are computationally efficient and enable cosmological parameter inference across a range of models, in contrast to numerical covariances derived from simulations or resampling, which are costly or biased. Our derivation is based on real-space estimators of the aperture mass. Substituting the Halofit power spectrum, BiHalofit bispectrum, and a halo-model tetraspectrum, we validate the model against numerical covariances from the $N$-body Scinet LIghtCone Simulations (SLICS) using shear catalogues and convergence maps. We perform a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis with both analytical and numerical covariances for several filter scale combinations. The cross-covariance separates into three terms governed by the power spectrum, bispectrum, and tetraspectrum, with the latter dominating. The analytical model qualitatively reproduces simulations, though differences arise from modelling approximations and numerical evaluation. Analytical contours are systematically tighter, with a combined figure of merit 72% of the numerical case, rising to 80% when small-scale information is excluded. This work completes the analytical covariance framework for second- and third-order aperture mass statistics, enabling joint parameter inference without large simulation suites.

 - **Abstract**
 Accretion disks are ubiquitous in astrophysics, appearing in diverse environments from planet-forming systems to X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei. Traditionally, modeling their dynamics requires computationally intensive (magneto)hydrodynamic simulations. Recently, Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising alternative. This approach trains neural networks directly on physical laws without requiring data. We for the first time demonstrate PINNs for solving the two-dimensional, time-dependent hydrodynamics of non-self-gravitating accretion disks. Our models provide solutions at arbitrary times and locations within the training domain, and successfully reproduce key physical phenomena, including the excitation and propagation of spiral density waves and gap formation from disk-companion interactions. Notably, the boundary-free approach enabled by PINNs naturally eliminates the spurious wave reflections at disk edges, which are challenging to suppress in numerical simulations. These results highlight how advanced machine learning techniques can enable physics-driven, data-free modeling of complex astrophysical systems, potentially offering an alternative to traditional numerical simulations in the future.

 - **Abstract**
 JWST has revealed an abundance of supermassive black holes (BHs) in the early Universe, and yet the lowest mass seed black holes that gave rise to these populations remain elusive. Here we present a systematic search for broad-line Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) in some of the faintest high-$z$ galaxies surveyed yet by combining ultra-deep JWST/NIRSpec G395M spectroscopy with the strong lensing aid in Abell S1063. By employing the profile of the [OIII]$\lambda 5007$ emission lines as a template for narrow-line components and carefully cross-validating with mock observations, we identify a sample of ten broad-line AGNs at $4.5<z<7.0$ (eight secure, two tentative). The inferred BH masses from the broad H$\alpha$ line explore the intermediate BH mass regime down to $\sim 10^{5.5}\,M_\odot$. The stellar mass ($M_*$) is estimated with a galaxy+AGN composite model, and we find the BH to stellar mass ratio spans down to $M_{\rm BH}/M_*\lesssim 0.1\%$, unveiling populations on the empirical $M_{\rm BH}-M*$ relation observed in the local universe. We also derive the black hole mass function and investigate its low-mass end at this epoch. While we confirm the agreement of our results with previous studies at $M_{\rm BH}\gtrsim10^{6.5}M_{\odot}$, we find the mass range of $\sim 10^{5.5}\,M_\odot$ features an enhanced abundance with respect to the extrapolated best-fit Schechter function. Comparison with theoretical models suggests that a possible origin for this enhanced abundance is the direct-collapse BH formation, supporting the scenario that the direct collapse of massive gas clouds is a significant pathway for the earliest supermassive BHs.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first detection of weak gravitational lensing around spectroscopically confirmed dwarf galaxies, using the large overlap between DESI DR1 spectroscopic data and DECADE/DES weak lensing catalogs. A clean dwarf galaxy sample with well-defined redshift and stellar mass cuts enables excess surface mass density measurements in two stellar mass bins ($\log \rm{M}_*=[8.2, 9.2]~M_\odot$ and $\log \rm{M}_*=[9.2, 10.2]~M_\odot$), with signal-to-noise ratios of $5.6$ and $12.4$ respectively. This signal-to-noise drops to $4.5$ and $9.2$ respectively for measurements without applying individual inverse probability (IIP) weights, which mitigates fiber incompleteness from DESI's targeting. The measurements are robust against variations in stellar mass estimates, photometric shredding, and lensing calibration systematics. Using a simulation-based modeling framework with stellar mass function priors, we constrain the stellar mass-halo mass relation and find a satellite fraction of $\simeq 0.3$, which is higher than previous photometric studies but $1.5\sigma$ lower than $\Lambda$CDM predictions. We find that IIP weights have a significant impact on lensing measurements and can change the inferred $f_{\rm{sat}}$ by a factor of two, highlighting the need for accurate fiber incompleteness corrections for dwarf galaxy samples. Our results open a new observational window into the galaxy-halo connection at low masses, showing that future massively multiplexed spectroscopic observations and weak lensing data will enable stringent tests of galaxy formation models and $\Lambda$CDM predictions.

 - **Abstract**
 Quantum Gravity models suggest that singularities in gravitational collapse can be replaced by bounces, leading to the formation of Planck star remnants (PSR) that survive as stable relics once the black holes evaporate to the Planck mass. Recently, we proposed that such relics can be a viable candidate for dark matter. Here we show that LIGO's upper limit on the gravitational wave background rules out a formation pathway of Planck mass relics as dark matter from Gaussian initial conditions. This leaves non-Gaussian primordial fluctuations as the only viable channel for making Planck mass relics as dark matter.

 - **Abstract**
 Contamination-free assessments of the interstellar medium and star formation in quasar host galaxies, particularly based on the far-infrared, offer insights into the role of supermassive black holes in galaxy evolution. Motivated by predictions of quasar heating of dust on both nuclear and galaxy-wide scales, we perform two-component (host galaxy + point source) modeling of high-resolution (~0.1") ALMA observations of the FIR continuum in Band 5 (lambda_rest~500 um) of three highly luminous quasars (L_bol~10^47 erg/s), powered by supermassive black holes having M_BH~10^9 M_sun, at z=2. We include Band 9 (lambda_rest~154 um; 0.06" and 0.3") data at high S/N which places further constraints on the unresolved nuclear component in two cases. To break the degeneracy between quasar and stellar heating, we use CO (J=5-4), observed in Band 5, to gauge the expected contribution of star formation to the infrared luminosity. We find very good agreement between the strength and spatial distribution of the extended continuum component and its prediction based on CO (J=5-4). This is supported by the location of our three quasars along the L_(CO 5-4)-L_(IR, SFR) luminosity relation for inactive star-forming galaxies. As a consequence, there is no evidence for additional continuum emission on extended scales which could be attributed to quasar-heated dust. As expected, the nuclear (i.e., torus) contribution is present and subdominant (12% in Band 9 for one quasar with a typical star-forming host) or non-existent (<8% in Band 9 for the starbursting host). Based on the continuum and CO, the presence of substantial levels of ongoing star formation agrees with previous estimates from unresolved ALMA continuum observations which finds SFRs consistent with star-forming main-sequence galaxies. Therefore, our results do not provide evidence for a quasar-mode feedback, even for the most luminous cases at z=2.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive stars regulate galaxy evolution and star formation through their powerful physical and chemical feedback, but their formation remains poorly understood. Accretion powered outflows can provide important diagnostics of massive star formation. We present first results from the SOMA Atomic Outflow Survey, a far-infrared massive star formation survey using the FIFI-LS spectrometer on SOFIA. We report detection of [OIII] $^3P_2\rightarrow^3P_1$ emission at 52 $\mu$m from the massive protostar G11.94-0.62, tracing highly ionized gas. We also detect [OI] $^3P_2\rightarrow^3P_1$ and $^3P_1\rightarrow^3P_0$ at 63 and 145 $\mu$m tracing atomic gas, as well as CO $J=14\rightarrow13$ at 186 $\mu$m from highly excited molecular gas. The [OIII] and [OI] lines exhibit large line widths ($\sim400$ and $\sim40-80$ km s$^{-1}$, respectively) and their morphologies are consistent with a wide-angle bipolar outflow. Molecular tracers ($^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, C$^{18}$O, H$_2$CO, and CH$_3$OH) observed with ALMA also suggest a self-consistent outflow morphology. Ionized nebula/PDR modeling imply an ionized outflow mass flux of $\sim8\times10^{-5}\:M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ and an atomic outflow mass flux of $\sim5\times10^{-6}\:M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, while the molecular outflow traced by CO has an implied mass flux of $\sim3\times10^{-4}\:M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. The mass and momentum flux in the ionized outflow is consistent with the main component of the primary disk wind, while the molecular component is mainly swept-up, secondary outflow gas. We also observe G11.94-0.62 with the LBT in the near-infrared, potentially tracing the base of wide-angle outflow cavities. SED modeling implies $m_\star = 22.4^{+21}_{-11}\:M_\odot$, while the [OIII] emission implies $m_*\gtrsim30\:M_\odot$ and that the protostar is in the final stages of its accretion.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy mergers funnel gas toward the nuclei, igniting starbursts and active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The AGN feedback can reshape the host galaxy and regulate both star formation and super-massive black-hole (SMBH) accretion. Using VLT/MUSE integral-field spectroscopy, we conduct a spatially resolved study of the triple-AGN candidate SDSS J0849+1114. Extended ionized gas structures ($>10$ kpc from nucleus A) primarily associated with tidal tails are detected. Meanwhile, two distinct ionized gas outflows are revealed. One extends over $>5$ kpc around nuclei A with a kinetic power of $\dot{E}_{\rm out,A} = 3.0\times10^{42}\rm\, erg\, s^{-1}$, which might be driven by the radio jet. The other outflow extends $\sim 5.9$ kpc around nucleus C, with a kinetic power of $\dot{E}_{\rm out,C} = 2.0\times10^{40}\rm\, erg\, s^{-1}$. High [O III]/H$\alpha$ and [N II]/H$\alpha$ ratios in the tidal gas require that nucleus A radiated at a high accretion rate with $L_{\rm A,bol} \sim 0.1$--$0.5\,L_{\rm Edd,A}$ at least $\sim3$--$\times10^{4}\rm\,yr$ ago, $20$--$100$ times brighter than today. Combined with multi-wavelength constraints, we find evidence for episodic AGN feedback that expelled circumnuclear gas and rapidly quenched accretion. This triple AGN candidate demonstrates how AGN feedback can self-regulate black hole growth and impact hosts during mergers.
