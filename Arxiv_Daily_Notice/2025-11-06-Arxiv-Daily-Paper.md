 - **Abstract**
 Strong gravitational lensing (SL) by galaxy clusters is a powerful probe of their inner mass distribution and a key test bed for cosmological models. However, the detection of SL events in wide-field surveys such as Euclid requires robust, automated methods capable of handling the immense data volume generated. In this work, we present an advanced deep learning (DL) framework based on mask region-based convolutional neural networks (Mask R-CNNs), designed to autonomously detect and segment bright, strongly-lensed arcs in Euclid's multi-band imaging of galaxy clusters. The model is trained on a realistic simulated data set of cluster-scale SL events, constructed by injecting mock background sources into Euclidised Hubble Space Telescope images of 10 massive lensing clusters, exploiting their high-precision mass models constructed with extensive spectroscopic data. The network is trained and validated on over 4500 simulated images, and tested on an independent set of 500 simulations, as well as real Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1) observations. The trained network achieves high performance in identifying gravitational arcs in the test set, with a precision and recall of 76% and 58%, respectively, processing 2'x2' images in a fraction of a second. When applied to a sample of visually confirmed Euclid Q1 cluster-scale lenses, our model recovers 66% of gravitational arcs above the area threshold used during training. While the model shows promising results, limitations include the production of some false positives and challenges in detecting smaller, fainter arcs. Our results demonstrate the potential of advanced DL computer vision techniques for efficient and scalable arc detection, enabling the automated analysis of SL systems in current and future wide-field surveys. The code, ARTEMIDE, is open source and will be available at this http URL.
#### Optimizing Earth-Moon Transfer and Cislunar Navigation: Integrating Low-Energy Trajectories, AI Techniques and GNSS-R Technologies

 - **Abstract**
 The rapid growth of cislunar activities, including lunar landings, the Lunar Gateway, and in-space refueling stations, requires advances in cost-efficient trajectory design and reliable integration of navigation and remote sensing. Traditional Earth-Moon transfers suffer from rigid launch windows and high propellant demands, while Earth-based GNSS systems provide little to no coverage beyond geostationary orbit. This limits autonomy and environmental awareness in cislunar space. This review compares four major transfer strategies by evaluating velocity requirements, flight durations, and fuel efficiency, and by identifying their suitability for both crewed and robotic missions. The emerging role of artificial intelligence and machine learning is highlighted: convolutional neural networks support automated crater recognition and digital terrain model generation, while deep reinforcement learning enables adaptive trajectory refinement during descent and landing to reduce risk and decision latency. The study also examines how GNSS-Reflectometry and advanced Positioning, Navigation, and Timing architectures can extend navigation capabilities beyond current limits. GNSS-R can act as a bistatic radar for mapping lunar ice, soil properties, and surface topography, while PNT systems support autonomous rendezvous, Lagrange point station-keeping, and coordinated satellite swarm operations. Combining these developments establishes a scalable framework for sustainable cislunar exploration and long-term human and robotic presence.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce a mock galaxy catalog built for the CSST extragalactic surveys using the primary runs of the Jiutian $N$-body simulation suites. The catalogs are built by coupling the GAlaxy Evolution and Assembly (GAEA) semi-analytical model of galaxy formation with merger trees extracted from the simulations using the Hierarchical Bound-Tracing (HBT+) algorithm. The spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and broadband magnitudes are computed using the neural-network-based stellar population synthesizer StarDuster, which is trained on radiative transfer simulations to account for detailed galaxy geometry in modeling dust obscuration. Galaxy light-cones up to $z=5$ are subsequently generated with the BLiC light-cone builder which interpolates the properties of galaxies over time using an optimized interpolation scheme. The resulting catalogs exhibit good convergence in many statistical properties of the galaxy population produced from two different resolution simulations. The catalogs reproduce a number of observed galaxy properties across a range of galaxy mass and redshift, including the stellar mass functions, the luminosity function, gas mass fraction, galaxy size-mass relation and galaxy clustering. We also present the photometric and redshift distributions of galaxies expected to be observed in the CSST surveys.
