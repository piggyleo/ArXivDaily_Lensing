#### Constraining Ultra-Light Dark Matter mass with Dwarf Galaxy Rotation Curves
 - **Authors:** Tian-yao Fang, Ming-Chung Chu
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12848

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12848

 - **Abstract**
 While ultra-light bosonic dark matter (ULDM) in a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) state could naturally account for the central core in some galaxies and resolve the core-cusp problem, the dark matter density distribution in the outer regions of galaxies remains less explored. We propose a trial wavefunction to model the ULDM distribution beyond the BEC core. We derive the corresponding rotation velocity curve, which shows excellent agreement with those of 12 dwarf spheroidal galaxies. The best-fit ULDM particle mass for each dwarf galaxy falls within a strikingly narrow range of $m=(1.8-3.2)\times 10^{-23}\text{eV}$.
#### Probabilistic Inference of Cosmological Density Parameters from Synthetic Hubble Expansion Data of Varying SNR Using Diverse Artificial Neural Network Architectures

 - **Abstract**
 This paper builds upon ParamANN's novel approach (S. Pal & R. Saha 2024) of using ANNs to infer cosmological density parameters by determining optimal architecture for varying synthetic Hubble data SNRs in estimating the density parameters $\Omega_{m, 0}$ and $\Omega_{\Lambda, 0}$ across redshift values $z \in [0, 1]$. To generate the synthetic data, this study randomly sampled initial free parameter values at $z=0$ from theoretically motivated priors and evolved them backwards using the first Friedmann Equation to generate clean $H(z)$ curves. Then, this paper adds realistic noise of high, normal, and low SNR by sampling relative uncertainties from a Gaussian KDE on 47 real data observations compiled by A. Bouali et al. (2023). In the end, this study found that a RNN that uses BiLSTM is the most effective for high and normal SNR data across four quantitative metrics. On the other hand, a combination of convolution and recurrent layers that uses GRU performed the best for low SNR data across the same four metrics. A comparison between the results of this paper's ANN predictions and those of ParamANN shows that all architectures tested in this paper regardless of training SNR are statistically consistent within 1 standard deviation of ParamANN. However, most ANN results are not statistically consistent within 3 standard deviations of Planck Collaboration et al. (2020), showing a significant difference between ANN and the more traditional MCMC methods used by Planck collaboration.

 - **Abstract**
 Dark matter fermions interacting via attractive fifth forces mediated by a light mediator can form dark matter halos in the very early universe. We show that bound systems composed of these halos are capable of generating gravitational wave (GW) signals detectable today, even when the individual halos are very light. The Yukawa force dominates the dynamics of these halo binaries, rather than gravity. As a result, large GW signals can be produced at initially extremely high frequencies, which are then redshifted to frequency bands accessible to current or future GW observatories. In addition, the resulting GW signals carry distinctive features that enable future observations to distinguish them from conventional ones. Notably, even if only a tiny fraction of dark matter experiences strong fifth-force interactions, such effects provide a new avenue to discover self-interacting dark matter through GW observations.

 - **Abstract**
 In these lecture notes, we describe the current state-of-the-art for numerical simulations of large-scale structure and galaxy formation. Numerical simulations play a central role in the preparation and the exploitation of large-scale galaxy surveys, in which galaxies are the fundamental observational objects. We first describe basic methods for collisionless N-body dynamics that enable us to model dark matter accurately by solving the Vlasov-Poisson equations. We then discuss simple methods to populate dark matter halos with galaxies, such as Halo and Sub-halo Abundance Matching techniques and baryonification techniques for capturing baryonic effects on the matter distribution. We finally describe how to model the gas component by solving the Euler-Poisson equations, focusing on the foundational assumptions behind these equations, namely local thermo-dynamical equilibrium, and the nature of the truncation errors of the numerical scheme, namely numerical diffusion. We show a few examples of simulations of a Milky-Way-like halo without cooling, with cooling and with star formation. We finally describe different subgrid prescriptions recently developed to model star formation, supernovae feedback and active galactic nuclei and how they impact cosmological simulations.
#### Dependency of the Bar Formation Timescale On The Halo Spin

 - **Abstract**
 Bars are among the most prominent structures in disk galaxies. While the widely accepted swing-amplification theory provides a qualitative framework for their formation, the detailed physical processes remain incompletely understood. Previous studies have shown that the bar formation timescale in isolated galaxies depends exponentially on the disk mass fraction (the so-called "Fujii relation") and linearly on disk hotness and thickness. However, the influence of dark matter halo spin on bar formation has not been systematically investigated. In this work, we construct a suite of $N$-body models of disk and halo with varying disk mass fractions and amounts of random motions. By introducing prograde and retrograde spins in the dark matter halo, we explore how halo spin modifies the established empirical relations governing bar formation timescales. We find that these relations remain valid in both prograde and retrograde halo spin models. For rapid bar formation (short timescale), the effect of halo spin is nearly negligible. In contrast, for moderately slow bar formation, prograde (retrograde) halo spin tends to accelerate (suppress) bar onset. In cases of extremely slow bar formation, halo spin introduces a stronger but more stochastic influence. These trends might arise from the exchange of angular momentum between the stellar disk and the dark matter halo.
#### Examining a new form of non-standard dark matter using DESI DR2 data
 - **Authors:** Yan-Hong Yao, Yi-Hao Shen, Tian-Nuo Li, Guo-Hong Du, Yungui Gong
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13436

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13436

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we propose a non-standard dark matter (NSDM) model in which the equation of state (EoS) of dark matter (DM) is parameterized as $w_{\rm dm} = w_2 a^2$, and this DM model is motivated by the idea that DM must become cold dark matter (CDM) in the neighborhood of the scale factor $a = 0$, which implies that both the EoS of DM, $w_{\rm dm}$, and its derivative with respect to the scale factor, ${\rm d}w_{\rm dm}/{\rm d}a$, vanish at $a = 0$. By incorporating the latest cosmological datasets -- including the Planck2018 Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) distance priors, the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation measurements from the Data Release 2 of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), together with three independent Type Ia Supernova datasets, namely the Dark Energy Survey Year 5 (DESY5) compilation, the Union3 compilation, and the PantheonPlus sample -- we constrain the $\Lambda w_2$DM, $ww_2$DM, and $w_0w_aw_2$DM models, which are constructed by replacing CDM with NSDM in the $\Lambda $CDM, $w$CDM, and $w_0w_a$CDM models, respectively. We find that there is a preference for a negative DM EoS at more than the $3\sigma$ confidence level for the data combinations CMB+DESI+Union3 and CMB+DESI+DESY5. Moreover, for all data combinations, replacing CDM with NSDM in the $w$CDM and $w_0w_a$CDM models significantly reduces the probability of violating the null energy condition. Furthermore, both $ww_2$DM and $w_0w_aw_2$DM are favored over $\Lambda $CDM with a significance comparable to that of the $w_0w_a$CDM model.

 - **Abstract**
 Photometric classification of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) is critical for cosmological studies but remains difficult due to class imbalance and observational noise. While deep learning models have been explored, they are often resource-intensive and lack interpretability. We present a computationally efficient and interpretable classification framework that maintains high performance on imbalanced datasets. We emphasize the use of PR-AUC and F1-score as more informative metrics than ROC-AUC in severely imbalanced settings. Using an XGBoost ensemble optimized via Bayesian hyperparameter tuning, we classified light curves from the Supernova Photometric Classification Challenge (SPCC), comprising 21,318 events with a 3.19 imbalance ratio (non-Ia to Ia). Our model achieved a PR-AUC of $0.993^{+0.03}_{-0.02}$, an F1-score of $0.923 \pm 0.008$, and a ROC-AUC of $0.976 \pm 0.004$, matching or exceeding deep learning performance on precision-recall trade-offs while using fewer resources. Despite slightly lower overall accuracy, our method balances false positives and false negatives, improving the efficiency of spectroscopic follow-up. We show that optimized ensemble models offer a reproducible and lightweight alternative to complex architectures, particularly for large-scale surveys such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) where transparency and efficiency are essential.
