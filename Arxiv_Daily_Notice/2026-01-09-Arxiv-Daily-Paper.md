 - **Abstract**
 The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array and the James Webb Space Telescope are transforming our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution in the early Universe. By combining their capabilities, these observatories provide unprecedented insights into the gas, dust, and stars of high-redshift galaxies at spatially resolved scales, unveiling the complexities of their interstellar medium, kinematics, morphology, active galactic nuclei, and star formation activity. This review summarizes recent breakthroughs in the study of galaxies during the first billion years of cosmic history, highlighting key discoveries, open questions, and current limitations. We discuss how observations, theoretical models, and simulations are shaping our understanding of early galaxy evolution and identify promising directions for future research. While significant progress can be achieved through optimized use of existing facilities and collaborative efforts, further advances will require enhanced angular resolution and sensitivity, motivating upgrades to current instruments and the development of next-generation observatories.

 - **Abstract**
 Spectroscopic observations by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have revealed young, compact, high-redshift ($z$) galaxies with high nitrogen-to-oxygen (N/O) ratios. GN-z11 at z=10.6 is one of these galaxies. One possible scenario for such a high N/O ratio is pollution from supermassive stars (SMSs), from which stellar winds are expected to be nitrogen-rich. The abundance pattern is determined by both galaxy evolution and SMS pollution, but so far, simple one-zone models have been used. Using a galaxy formation simulation, we tested the SMS scenario. We used a cosmological zoom-in simulation that includes chemical evolution driven by rotating massive stars (Wolf-Rayet stars), supernovae, and asymptotic giant branch stars. As a post-process, we assumed the formation of an SMS with a mass between $10^3$ and $10^5$ $M_\odot$ and investigated the contribution of its ejecta to the abundance pattern. The N/O ratio was enhanced by the SMS ejecta, and the abundance pattern of GN-z11, including carbon-to-oxygen and oxygen-to-hydrogen ratios, was reproduced by our SMS pollution model if the pollution mass fraction ranges within 10-30 per cent. Such a pollution fraction can be realized when the gas ionized by the SMS is polluted, and the gas density is $10^4$-$10^5$ cm$^{-3}$ assuming a Strömgren sphere. We also compared the abundance pattern with those of other N/O-enhanced high-$z$ galaxies. Some of these galaxies can also be explained by SMS pollution.

 - **Abstract**
 The field of time-domain astronomy has experienced unprecedented growth due to the increasing deployment of robotic telescopes capable of autonomous, round-the-clock sky monitoring. These instruments have revolutionized the detection and characterization of transient phenomena such as supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, variable stars, and gravitational wave counterparts. This paper explores the transformative role of robotic telescopes such as ZTF, ATLAS, and LCOGT in enabling rapid-response observations and building large time-series datasets. We review the design principles and scheduling algorithms behind robotic observatories and assess their scientific contributions across different wavelength regimes. Particular attention is given to the synergy between robotic systems and machine learning pipelines that enable real-time classification of transient events. We also discuss challenges such as data deluge, follow-up prioritization, and observational biases, as well as future directions in global telescope networks
#### Explainable machine learning classification of \textit{Chandra} X-ray sources: SHAP analysis of multi-wavelength features

 - **Abstract**
 Extensive astronomical surveys, like those conducted with the {\em Chandra} X-ray Observatory, detect hundreds of thousands of unidentified cosmic sources. Machine learning (ML) methods offer an efficient, probabilistic approach to classify them, which can be useful for making discoveries and conducting deeper studies. In earlier work, we applied the LightGBM (ML model) to classify 277,069 {\em Chandra} point sources into eight categories: active galactic nuclei (AGN), X-ray emitting stars, young stellar objects (YSO), high-mass X-ray binaries, low-mass X-ray binaries, ultraluminous X-ray sources, cataclysmic variables, and pulsars. In this work, we present the classification table of 54,770 robustly classified sources (over $3\sigma$ confidence), including 14,066 sources at $>4\sigma$ significance. To ensure classification reliability and gain a deeper insight, we investigate the multiwavelength feature relationships learned by the LightGBM model, focusing on AGNs, Stars, and YSOs. We employ Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques, specifically, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), to quantify the contribution of individual features and their interactions to the predicted classification probabilities. Among other things, we find infrared-optical and X-ray decision boundaries for separating AGN/Stars, and infrared-X-ray boundaries for YSOs. These results are crucial for estimating object classes even with limited multiwavelength data. This study represents one of the earliest applications of XAI to large-scale astronomical datasets, demonstrating ML models' potential for uncovering physically meaningful patterns in data in addition to classification. Finally, our publicly available, extensive, and interactive catalogue will be helpful to explore the contributions of features and their combinations in greater detail in the future.
#### sidmkit: A Reproducible Toolkit for SIDM Phenomenology and Galaxy Rotation-Curve Modeling

 - **Abstract**
 Self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) is a well-motivated extension of cold dark matter that can modify halo structure on galactic and group scales while remaining consistent with large-scale structure. However, practical SIDM work often requires bridging several layers, including microphysical scattering models, velocity-dependent effective cross sections, phenomenological astrophysical constraints, and (separately) data-driven halo fits, such as rotation curves. In this paper, we describe \texttt{sidmkit}, a transparent and reproducible Python package designed to support SIDM ``micro$\rightarrow$macro'' calculations and to provide a robust batch pipeline for fitting rotation curves in the SPARC data. On the SIDM side, \texttt{sidmkit} implements velocity-dependent momentum-transfer cross sections for a Yukawa interaction using standard analytic approximations (Born, classical, and Hulthén-based) with a numerical partial-wave option for spot checks. It also provides consistent velocity-moment averaging for Maxwellian relative speeds, scattering-rate utilities, and curated literature \emph{summary} constraints for regression tests and exploratory scans. On the rotation-curve side, we implement bounded non-linear least squares fits of NFW and Burkert halo models to SPARC baryonic decompositions, with optional mass-to-light priors and information-criterion summaries (AIC/BIC). For the demonstration dataset, we process 191 \texttt{rotmod} galaxies (LTG+ETG bundles) and fit both NFW and Burkert models (382 total fits). We find that Burkert is preferred by $\Delta \mathrm{BIC} > 0$ for $65.4\%$ of galaxies, with ``strong'' preference ($\Delta \mathrm{BIC}>6$) in $32.5\%$ of galaxies;
#### Optimization of Deep Learning Models for Radio Galaxy Classification

 - **Abstract**
 Modern radio telescope surveys, capable of detecting billions of galaxies in wide-field surveys, have made manual morphological classification impracticable. This applies in particular when the Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO) becomes operable in 2027, which is expected to close an important gap in our understanding of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) and other areas of astrophysics. To this end, foreground objects, contaminants of the 21-cm signal, need to be identified and subtracted. Source finding and identification is thus an important albeit challenging task. We investigate the ability of AI and deep learning (DL) methods that have been previously trained on other data domains to localize and classify radio galaxies with minimal changes to their architectures. Various well-known pretrained neural network architectures for image classification and object detection are trained and fine-tuned and their performance is evaluated on a public radio galaxy dataset derived from the Radio Galaxy Zoo. A comparison between convolutional neural network (CNN)- and transformer-based algorithms is performed. The best performing architecture is systematically optimized and an uncertainty estimation is performed by means of an ensemble analysis. Radio source classification performance nearly comparable to the current leading customized models can be obtained using existing standard pretrained DL architectures, without modification and increase in complexity of the model architectures but rather adaptation of the data, by combining various transformations on replicated image channels. Using an ensemble of models can also further improve performance to over 90% accuracy, on par with top-performing models in the literature. The results can be transferred to other survey data, e.g. from the Murchison Wide-field Array (MWA), and in the future be used to study the EoR with the SKAO.
#### First measurement of the Hubble constant from a combined weak lensing and gravitational-wave standard siren analysis
 - **Authors:** Felipe Andrade-Oliveira, David Sanchez-Cid, Danny Laghi, Marcelle Soares-Santos

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04774

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04774

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new measurement of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) resulting from the first joint analysis of standard sirens with weak gravitational lensing and galaxy clustering observables comprising three two-point correlation functions (3$\times$2pt). For the 3$\times$2pt component of the analysis, we use data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 3 release. For the standard sirens component, we use data from the Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog 4.0 released by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) Collaboration. For GW170817, the only standard siren for which extensive electromagnetic follow-up observations exist, we also use measurements of the host galaxy redshift and inclination angle estimates derived from observations of a superluminal jet from its remnant. Our joint analysis yields $H_0 = 67.9^{+4.4}_{-4.3}$~km~s$^{-1}$~Mpc$^{-1}$, a $6.4\%$ measurement, while improving the DES constraint on the total abundance of matter $\Omega_m$ by $22\%$. Removing the jet information degrades the $H_0$ precision to $9.9\%$. The measurement of $H_0$ remains a central problem in cosmology with a multitude of approaches being vigorously pursued in the community aiming to reconcile significantly discrepant measurements at the percent-level. In light of the impending new data releases from DES and LVK, and anticipating much more constraining power from 3$\times$2pt observables using newly commissioned survey instruments, we demonstrate that incorporating standard sirens into the cosmology framework of large cosmic surveys is a viable route towards that goal.
#### Symbolically regressing dark matter halo profiles using weak lensing

 - **Abstract**
 The structure of dark matter haloes is often described by radial density profiles motivated by cosmological simulations. These are typically assumed to have a fixed functional form (e.g. NFW), with some free parameters that can be constrained with observations. However, relying on simulations has the disadvantage that the resulting profiles depend on the dark matter model and the baryonic physics implementation, which are highly uncertain. Instead, we present a method to constrain halo density profiles directly from observations. This is done using a symbolic regression algorithm called Exhaustive Symbolic Regression (ESR). ESR searches for the optimal analytic expression to fit data, combining both accuracy and simplicity. We apply ESR to a sample of 149 galaxy clusters from the HSC-XXL survey to identify which functional forms perform best across the entire sample of clusters. We identify density profiles that statistically outperform NFW under a minimum-description-length criterion. Within the radial range probed by the weak-lensing data ($R \sim 0.3 - 3$ h$^{-1}$ Mpc), the highest-ranked ESR profiles exhibit shallow inner behaviour and a maximum in the density profile. As a practical application, we show how the best-fitting ESR models can be used to obtain enclosed mass estimates. We find masses that are, on average, higher than those derived using NFW, highlighting a source of potential bias when assuming the wrong density profile. These results have important knock-on effects for analyses that utilise clusters, for example cosmological constraints on $\sigma_8$ and $\Omega_m$ from cluster abundance and clustering. Beyond the HSC dataset, the method is readily applicable to any data constraining the dark matter distribution in galaxies and galaxy clusters, such as other weak lensing surveys, galactic rotation curves, or complementary probes.
