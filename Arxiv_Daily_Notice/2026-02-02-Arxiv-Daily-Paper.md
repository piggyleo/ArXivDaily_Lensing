#### Isotropic Equivalence of STVG--MOG and $Λ$CDM and Its Breakdown in Large--Scale Anisotropic Cosmological Observables

 - **Abstract**
 We show that Scalar-Tensor-Vector Gravity (STVG-MOG) is observationally equivalent to the standard model $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model for all probes that depend on isotropic and linear gravitational dynamics, including galaxy rotation curves, cluster lensing, the linear matter power spectrum P(k), $\sigma_8$, baryon acoustic oscillations, and the cosmic microwave background (CMB). This degeneracy arises from the scale-dependent effective gravitational coupling $G_{\mathrm{eff}}$, which ensures identical background evolution, transfer functions, and linear growth. Consequently, all early-universe, low and intermediate scale cosmological observables are equally well described by STVG-MOG without invoking non-baryonic dark matter. We argue that the equivalence implies that isotropic cosmological data alone cannot establish the physical existence of dark matter. The degeneracy is broken only by observables sensitive to large-scale, anisotropic gravitational response. In particular, recent measurements of enhanced radio-galaxy and quasar number-count dipoles at gigaparsec scales probe a regime where $G_{\mathrm{eff}}$ departs from its $\Lambda$CDM limit, allowing STVG-MOG to generate anisotropic bulk flows, while preserving consistency with all isotropic constraints. These observations provide a concrete pathway for empirically distinguishing modified gravity from particle dark matter.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an updated gravitational lens model of the Bullet cluster (1E 0657-56) by combining JWST NIRCam imaging and NIRSpec spectroscopy. Although previous lens models relied on many multiply imaged galaxies, only six systems had spectroscopic redshifts prior to this work. Our lens model is constrained by a catalogue of 135 secure multiple images from 27 background galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts, uniformly covering both subclusters and a wide redshift range of 0.9 - 6.7. We also provide a catalogue of 199 multiple image candidates. We model the cluster with Lenstool and incorporate several large-scale haloes, cluster members, the intracluster gas, and group-scale haloes surrounding the cluster core, motivated by spectroscopic studies of cluster member kinematics. We describe the main cluster component with a complex, elongated double-peaked distribution, and the subcluster with a single large-scale halo aligning closely with the brightest cluster galaxy ($4_{-2}^{+4}$ kpc). The uncertainty of the alignment is improved threefold with the addition of JWST systems. The addition of group-scale substructures, roughly following the two axes of cluster assembly, improves the fit to the multiple image positions and provides a physically motivated alternative to constant shear. Our lens model shows the closest agreement with previous studies in aperture mass profiles at $\sim60$ kpc from the BCGs, but exhibits significant differences in the detailed mass distribution as a result of different lens-modelling strategies and adopted constraints. The differences are reflected in small but spatially coherent deviations between the new spectroscopic redshifts and redshifts predicted by earlier lens models.
#### Distinguishing the nature of dark matter by mapping cosmic filaments from Lyman-alpha emission
 - **Authors:** Yizhou Liu, Liang Gao, Shihong Liao, Kai Zhu, Yingjie Jing, Huijie Hu

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22677

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.22677

 - **Abstract**
 The standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model predicts that cosmic filaments are highly clumpy, whereas warm dark matter -- invoked to address small-scale challenges in $\Lambda$CDM -- produces filaments that are noticeably smoother and less structured. In this work, we investigate the potential of Lyman $\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) emission to trace cosmic filaments at redshifts $z=2.5$ and $z=4$, and assess their potential for constraining the nature of dark matter. Our analysis shows that Ly$\alpha$ filaments provide a promising observational probe of dark matter: at $z=4$, differences in filament smoothness and surface brightness serve as distinctive signatures between models. Looking ahead, the upcoming generation of 30-meter class telescopes will be critical for enabling these measurements, offering a compelling opportunity to distinguish the nature of dark matter by mapping the structure of cosmic filaments.
#### Linear perturbation theory and structure formation in a Brans-Dicke theory of gravity without dark matter

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.22937

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the formation of the large-scale cosmic structure in a scalar-tensor theory of gravity belonging to the class of the Brans--Dicke theories. The universe contains baryonic matter alone and neither dark matter nor dark energy. The two arbitrary functions of the scalar field characterizing the kinetic term and the self-interaction potential are set to $W(\varphi)=-1$ and $V(\varphi) = -\Xi \varphi$, respectively, with $\Xi$ a positive constant. In the weak-field limit, the theory reduces to Refracted Gravity, a non-relativistic theory whose modified Poisson equation contains the scalar field $\varphi$ that provides the gravitational boost required to describe the dynamics of galaxies and galaxy clusters without dark matter. In a flat, matter-dominated, homogeneous and isotropic universe the same scalar field $\varphi$ drives the accelerated expansion of the universe and describes the observed redshift evolution of the Hubble-Lemaître parameter $H(z)$. However, in the equation of the growth factor of the linear perturbation theory, the form of $V(\varphi)$ makes the coefficient of the source of the gravitational field proportional to $H^{-1}(z)$; therefore the gravitational field is strongly suppressed at early times and structure formation is delayed to redshift $z< 1$, in disagreement with the observation of formed galaxies at much larger redshifts. In addition, the form of $W(\varphi)$ and a linear $V(\varphi)$ imply that $\varphi$ generates twice the gravitational boost on massive particles than on photons, with possible observable consequences on the gravitational lensing phenomenon. It remains to be investigated whether different choices of $W(\varphi)$ and $V(\varphi)$, that can still make the theory reduce to Refracted Gravity in the weak-field limit, might alleviate these problems.
#### Contrastive Learning of Extragalactic Stellar Streams: Sculpting a Latent Space of Representations with DES DR2 Photometry

 - **Abstract**
 We present a self-supervised approach for characterizing low surface brightness tidal features in wide-field imaging data by applying the nearest-neighbor contrastive learning of visual representations (NNCLR) algorithm to a curated subset of the Dark Energy Survey Data Release 2 (DES DR2). We construct 38,334 cutouts of well-resolved galaxies in the g, r, i bands, applying a novel "tiered sigmoid scaling function" to dynamically adjust image contrast according to the object's signal-to-noise and background level. A supplemental labeled sample of 366 galaxies enables qualitative assessment of the learned embeddings. We train a convolutional neural network with image augmentations including injection of simulated background stars, and project the resulting 512-dimensional representations into two dimensions using uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) and its local density preserving variant (densMAP). We find that the NNCLR latent space recovers global trends corresponding to major merger features, yet does not reliably separate stellar streams without further supervision. To interpret the network's implicit attention, we compute gradient-based saliency maps averaged over the full dataset: these reveal that the tiered sigmoid scaling effectively attenuates information from the center of the image cutouts, thereby suppressing the learning of high surface brightness features of each image cutout's central galaxy. Our study provides a blueprint for leveraging contrastive methods to mine forthcoming survey data for faint tidal substructure, and highlights key preprocessing and interpretability considerations for robust stream detection.
#### MARVELously Dark: the gravothermal evolution of dwarf halos in velocity-dependent SIDM

 - **Abstract**
 Self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) with a sufficiently large cross section has been shown to naturally produce constant dark matter (DM) cores, as well as core-collapse, at the centers of dwarf halos on cosmic timescales, potentially reducing tensions with observation. Here, we present halos from a new dark matter only (DMO) cosmological (SIDM) simulation: this http URL DMO with a velocity-dependent self-interaction cross section with $\sigma/m_\text{max} = 50$ cm$^2$/g at $v_\text{max} = 35$ km/s. We compare these to the CDM suite of Storm simulations including both DMO and dark matter + hydrodynamics runs, in order to test core-formation (and core-collapse) across different dark matter models. We show that this http URL DMO can reproduce core slopes consistent with observations of isolated dwarf galaxies and more massive ($\text{M}_{vir} \gtrsim 10^{10} M_{\odot}$) CDM dwarf halos that include stellar feedback from the matched CDM run (Storm CDM+baryons). We identify nine this http URL SIDM DMO halos in the core-collapse phase of gravothermal evolution with halo masses below $2\times 10^9 M_{\odot}$. We find that using core slope to measure the core-collapse timescales of this http URL DMO halos agrees well with predicted collapse times estimated with the parametric model for SIDM halos introduced by \cite{Yang2023}. Additionally, compared to central density, core slope is less sensitive to both the radius of measurement and halo merger history. These results indicate that the slope of the inner DM density profile more cleanly differentiates core-collapsed versus core-forming halos than central density amplitude.
