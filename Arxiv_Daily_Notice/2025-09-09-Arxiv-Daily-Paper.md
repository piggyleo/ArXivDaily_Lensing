#### Macromodel-free flux-ratio prediction in quadruply imaged quasars with local constraints from lensed arcs

 - **Abstract**
 Strong gravitational lensing is a powerful cosmological probe, providing a direct tool to unveil the properties of dark matter (DM) on sub-galactic scales. In particular, flux-ratio anomalies in quadruply imaged quasars ("quads") can reveal the presence of dark substructure, such that population-level statistics can be used to constrain the particle nature of DM. Current methods, however, rely on globally parametrized models ("macromodels") of the lens mass distribution, which impose rigid physical assumptions on the deflection field. Given the high stakes, it is important to develop complementary methods that do not require the assumption of a macromodel. One promising avenue consists of modeling the resolved emission from the quasar host galaxy (lensed arcs) using a local lensing formalism like the Curved Arc Basis (CAB) description. In this paper, we test the ability of CAB models to predict flux ratios from mock imaging data. We find that CAB model-predicted flux ratios accurately reproduce the expected values, with a typical precision of $\sim 3-5\%$. While a macromodel-based approach yields smaller uncertainties, as expected, the CAB method permits a more flexible, local description of the deflection field, thus being more robust to angular structure in the main deflector mass profile, in particular avoiding false-positive detections of flux-ratio anomalies that can arise with overly simplistic parametrizations. On the other hand, by injecting individual DM halos near quasar images, we demonstrate that CAB models do not absorb the local lensing perturbations from DM substructure, and can therefore distinguish flux-ratio anomalies caused by DM substructure from other sources of small-scale perturbation. We conclude that CAB models can be used to infer DM properties from flux-ratio anomaly statistics with minimal assumptions, complementing the traditional macromodel based approach.

 - **Abstract**
 We examine velocity-dependent dark matter annihilation in subhalos using a sample of six Milky Way-like galaxies from the Aurgia simulation suite. We quantify the enhancement in the annihilation rate in subhalos when including the contribution from particles in the smooth component of the halo that overlap with the subhalos. The enhancement in the annihilation rate scales with the smooth component of the host halo dark matter density, and is evident for subhalos over the resolvable mass range. Maximal enhancement factors are ~ 48 for p-wave models, and ~ 37,000 for d-wave models. For p and d-wave annihilation models, ~ 13 and ~ 6 subhalos, respectively, across all six host halos have emission from dark matter annihilation in their direction that is above the foreground emission from the smooth dark matter component, and would therefore be resolvable as sources. Such subhalos with the most significant enhancement factors tend to be on the lower end of the mass range and located closer to the center of the host galaxy. We provide a prescription to calculate the enhancement for subhalos as a function of distance from the Galactic center, and use this to examine the impact on dark matter limits from a couple of example dwarf spheroidals. We show that, including the enhancement factors, limits from individual dwarf spheroidals are at a cross section scale that may approach those derived from the Galactic center.
#### Comparison of Photometric and Spectroscopic Labels in Classifying Dusty Stellar Sources Using Machine Learning in the Magellanic Clouds

 - **Abstract**
 Dusty stellar sources, including young stellar objects (YSOs) and evolved stars such as oxygen- and carbon-rich AGBs (OAGBs, CAGBs), red supergiants (RSGs), and post-AGB stars (PAGBs), play a key role in the chemical enrichment of galaxies. Photometric surveys in the Magellanic Clouds have cataloged many such objects, but their classifications are often uncertain due to overlaps between populations. We trained machine learning models on spectroscopically labeled data from the SAGE project and applied them to photometric catalogs. The spectroscopic model achieves about 89\% accuracy. Applied to photometric labels, nearly all OAGBs are correctly identified, and YSOs have a 95\% confirmation rate. In contrast, 16\% of CAGBs are reclassified as OAGBs, only 8\% of RSGs retain their labels, and fewer than half of PAGBs are confirmed. Photometry is thus reliable for abundant populations with distinct signatures, but spectroscopic confirmation remains essential for rare or overlapping stellar classes.
#### Uncertainty-Aware Neural Networks for Fuzzy Dark Matter Model Selection from \texorpdfstring{$x_{\rm HI}$}{x_HI} Measurements

 - **Abstract**
 The nature of dark matter remains a central question in cosmology, with fuzzy dark matter (FDM) models offering a compelling alternative to the cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm. We explore FDM scenarios by performing 21-cm simulations across a parameter space with \texorpdfstring{$f_{\rm FDM} \in [0.02, 0.10]$}{f_FDM in [0.02, 0.10]} and \texorpdfstring{$m_{\rm FDM} \in [10^{-24}, 10^{-21}]\,\mathrm{eV}$}{m_FDM in [10^-24, 10^-21] eV}, obtaining global neutral hydrogen fractions (\texorpdfstring{$x_{\rm HI}$}{x_HI}) for each model. Observational \texorpdfstring{$x_{\rm HI}$}{x_HI} data and associated uncertainties from JWST are incorporated by estimating full probability density functions (PDFs) for both \texorpdfstring{$x_{\rm HI}$}{x_HI} and redshift \texorpdfstring{$z$}{z} using Bayesian inference with the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), yielding non-Gaussian multivariate uncertainty distributions. A hybrid machine learning framework is then trained on these observational PDFs to learn both central values and correlated uncertainties in \texorpdfstring{$x_{\rm HI}$}{x_HI} and \texorpdfstring{$z$}{z}, iteratively refining its parameters in each training epoch through direct incorporation of the multivariate PDFs derived from observational constraints. We then compare the simulation outputs to the machine-learned observational trends to identify the most consistent models. Our results indicate that FDM models with \texorpdfstring{$m_{\rm FDM} \simeq 10^{-22}\,\mathrm{eV}$}{m_FDM approx 10^-22 eV} and \texorpdfstring{$f_{\rm FDM} \simeq 0.04$}{f_FDM approx 0.04} best match current data, while lighter masses are strongly constrained. By integrating simulations and machine learning in an uncertainty-aware framework, this work explores the physics of the early Universe and guides future studies of 21-cm cosmology and reionization.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar eruptive events are complex phenomena, which most often include coronal mass ejections (CME), CME-driven compressive and shock waves, flares, and filament eruptions. CMEs are large eruptions of magnetized plasma from the Sun's outer atmosphere or corona, that propagate outward into the interplanetary space. Over the last several decades a large amount of remote solar eruption observational data has become available from ground-based and space-borne instruments. This has recently required the development of software approaches for automated characterisation of eruptive features. Most solar feature detection and tracking algorithms currently in use have restricted applicability and complicated processing chains, while complexity in engineering machine learning (ML) training sets limit the use of data-driven approaches for tracking or solar eruptive related phenomena. Recently, we introduced Wavetrack - a general algorithmic method for smart characterization and tracking of solar eruptive features. The method, based on a-trous wavelet decomposition, intensity rankings and a set of filtering techniques, allows to simplify and automate image processing and feature tracking. Previously, we applied the method successfully to several types of remote solar observations. Here we present the natural evolution of this approach. We discuss various aspects of applying Machine Learning (ML) techniques towards segmentation of high-dynamic range heliophysics observations. We trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) image segmentation models using feature masks obtained from the Wavetrack code. We present results from pre-trained models for segmentation of solar eruptive features and demonstrate their performance on a set of CME events based on SDO/AIA instrument data.
#### The 21 cm forest one-dimensional power spectrum as a probe of dark matter particles and primordial black holes

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the nature of dark matter (DM) particles remains a pivotal challenge in modern cosmology. Current cosmological research on these phenomena primarily utilizes cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations and other late-time probes, which predominantly focus on large scales. We introduce a novel probe, the 21 cm forest signal, which can be used to investigate DM properties on small scales during the epoch of reionization, thereby addressing the gap left by other cosmological probes. Annihilation and decay of DM particles, as well as Hawking radiation from PBHs, can heat the intergalactic medium (IGM). This heating suppresses the amplitude of the 21 cm forest 1D power spectrum. Therefore, the 1D power spectrum provides an effective method for constraining DM properties. However, astrophysical heating processes in the early universe can also affect the 21 cm forest 1D power spectrum. In this work, we assess the potential of using the SKA to observe the 21 cm forest 1D power spectrum for constraining DM properties, under the assumption that astrophysical heating can be constrained reliably by other independent probes. Under low astrophysical heating conditions, the 1D power spectrum could constrain the DM annihilation cross section and decay lifetime to $\langle\sigma v\rangle \sim {10^{-31}}\,{\rm cm^{3}\,s^{-1}}$ and $\tau \sim {10^{30}}\,{\rm s}$ for ${10}\,{\rm GeV}$ DM particles, and probe PBHs with masses $\sim {10^{15}}\,{\rm\,g}$ at abundances $f_{\mathrm{PBH}} \simeq 10^{-13}$. These constraints represent improvements of 5-6 orders of magnitude over current limits. Furthermore, the 21 cm forest 1D power spectrum has the potential to exceed existing bounds on sub-GeV DM and to probe PBHs with masses above $10^{18}\,{\rm g}$, which are otherwise inaccessible by conventional cosmological probes.
#### Solar--System Experiments in the Search for Dark Energy and Dark Matter

 - **Abstract**
 We reassess the realistic discovery reach of Solar--System experiments for dark energy (DE) and dark matter (DM) and quantify their complementarity to dedicated cosmological probes, such as the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and Euclid mission. In scalar-tensor frameworks with universal conformal coupling $A(\phi)$, screening (chameleon/symmetron, Vainshtein) suppresses fifth forces in deep Solar potentials, consistent with the gravitational-wave speed bound $|c_{\tt T}/c-1|\lesssim 10^{-15}$. We treat Solar--System tests as hypothesis-driven probes: we assemble quantitative guardrails (MICROSCOPE $\eta$, Cassini $\gamma$, LLR $\dot G/G$ and SEP, ephemeris limits on $\rho_{\rm DM}$ and Yukawa $\alpha(\lambda)$, and clock-network searches for ultralight DM), place them alongside current cosmology posteriors, and provide an explicit map from cosmology-level linear response (e.g., $\mu_{\rm lin,0}$) to local residuals using the screening relations (thin--shell and Vainshtein). Guided by systematics-gated criteria, we outline a near-term program -- solar-conjunction Shapiro-delay and Doppler/range tests, sustained millimeter-class LLR, global optical-clock links, refined ephemerides, and spaceborne atom interferometry (AIS) -- with realistic sensitivities $|\gamma-1|\in (2$--$5)\times 10^{-6}$, $\eta_{\rm EEP}\sim10^{-16}$--$10^{-17}$ (AIS/LLR), $|\dot{G}/G|\lesssim (2$--$5)\times 10^{-14}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, a uniform $\simeq 2\times$ tightening of AU-scale Yukawa/DM-density bounds, and $3$--$10\times$ gains in ultralight-DM couplings from clock networks. Primary discovery potential for late-time dark energy lies with multi-probe cosmology (geometry and growth), while a hypothesis-driven Solar--System program supplies high-leverage falsification and selective discovery windows for dark matter with ultralight mediators or long-range forces.

 - **Abstract**
 The Wang-Sheeley-Arge (WSA) model has been the cornerstone of operational solar wind forecasting for nearly two decades, owing to its simplicity and physics-based formalism. However, its performance is strongly dependent on several empirical parameters that are typically fixed or tuned manually, limiting its adaptability across varying solar conditions. In this study, we present a neural enhancement to the WSA framework (referred to as WSA+) that systematically optimizes the empirical parameters of the WSA solar wind speed relation using in-situ observations within a differentiable physics-constrained pipeline. The approach operates in two stages: first, a neural optimizer adjusts WSA parameters independently for each Carrington Rotation to better match the observed solar wind data. Then, a neural network learns to predict these optimized speed maps directly from magnetogram-derived features. This enables generalization of the optimization process and allows inference for new solar conditions without manual tuning. The developed WSA+ preserves the interpretability of the original relation while significantly improving the match with OMNI in-situ data across multiple performance metrics, including correlation and error statistics. It consistently outperforms the traditional WSA relation across both low and high solar activity periods, with average improvements of approximately 40 percent. By integrating data-driven learning with physical constraints, WSA+ offers a robust and adaptable enhancement, with immediate utility as a drop-in replacement in global heliospheric modeling pipelines.

 - **Abstract**
 We conduct an indirect dark matter (DM) search in the Galactic Center, focusing on a square region within $\pm 9^{\circ}$ in Galactic longitude and latutide, using 2,865 days of data ($\sim$8 years) from the High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Observatory. We explore DM particles within the Weakly Interacting Massive Particles framework with masses from 1 TeV to 10 PeV. Analyzing three annihilation channels ($b\bar{b}$, $\tau^{+}\tau^{-}$, $W^{+}W^{-}$) and three density profiles (Navarro-Frenk-White, Einasto, Burkert), we find no significant excess and set 95\% confidence-level upper limits on the velocity-weighted annihilation cross section. Our results provide the first constraints on DM particles well above 100 TeV using gamma-ray data from the Galactic Center, with the strongest limits $\mathcal{O}(10^{-24})$~cm$^{3}$/s, from the $\tau^{+}\tau^{-}$ channel and the Einasto profile.
#### Core or Halo? Two-Fluid Analysis of Dark Matter-Admixed Quarkyonic Stars in the Multi-Messenger Era

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.06684

 - **Abstract**
 For the first time, we explore dark matter (DM) admixed quarkyonic stars (DAQSs) within a two-fluid formalism, where the normal/visible sector is modeled by a quarkyonic equation of state (EOS) in the Effective Relativistic Mean Field (E-RMF) framework and the DM component is treated as a degenerate fermionic gas with scalar and vector self-interactions. Our analysis begins with the mass-radius (M-R) relation, showing that the inclusion of DM enables stellar configurations to reach the mass range compatible with the GW190814 event. We identify both DM core and DM halo morphologies among the viable EOSs, with core dominated and halo dominated cases exhibiting distinct signatures. By fixing the stellar mass within the GW190814 range, we constrain the possible dark matter fractions and explore the role of different interaction channels. Using the EOSs consistent with these constraints, we further investigate the tidal deformability ($\Lambda$), moment of inertia (MOI), and stellar radius, finding broad agreement with constraints from GW170817, GW190814, and NICER. Finally, we compile the characteristic properties of DAQSs, including EOS type, DM fractions, morphology (core vs halo), and macroscopic observables in a comparative summary. This study provides a unified two-fluid framework to explore dense QCD matter and dark matter in the multi-messenger era, suggesting that the GW190814 secondary object could plausibly be interpreted as either a DM core or a DM halo quarkyonic star.

 - **Abstract**
 Convolutional neural networks have shown their ability to differentiate between self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) and cold dark matter (CDM) on galaxy cluster scales. However, their large parameter counts and ''black-box'' nature make it difficult to assess whether their decisions adhere to physical principles. To address this issue, we have built a Convolutional Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (CKAN) that reduces parameter count and enhances interpretability, and propose a novel analytical framework to understand the network's decision-making process. With this framework, we leverage our network to qualitatively assess the offset between the dark matter distribution center and the galaxy cluster center, as well as the size of heating regions in different models. These findings are consistent with current theoretical predictions and show the reliability and interpretability of our network. By combining network interpretability with unseen test results, we also estimate that for SIDM in galaxy clusters, the minimum cross-section $(\sigma/m)_{\mathrm{th}}$ required to reliably identify its collisional nature falls between $0.1\,\mathrm{cm}^2/\mathrm{g}$ and $0.3\,\mathrm{cm}^2/\mathrm{g}$. Moreover, CKAN maintains robust performance under simulated JWST and Euclid noise, highlighting its promise for application to forthcoming observational surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 The stellar initial mass function (sIMF) describes the distribution of stellar masses formed in a single star formation event in a molecular cloud clump. It is fundamental to astrophysics and cosmology, shaping our understanding of unresolved stellar populations, galactic chemical enrichment and habitable zones, and black hole growth. This White Paper reviews studies on the core mass function, stellar multiplicity, and dynamical processes affecting sIMF determinations, as well as the link between star-forming clumps and the galaxy-wide IMF (gIMF). The evidence gleaned from observed systems for the dependency of the sIMF on the metallicity and density of the clump is portrayed. We examine evidence from gravitational lensing, stellar and gas kinematics, and spectral diagnostics to assess environmental dependencies of the gIMF. Theoretical perspectives provide further insights into the sIMF's variability. Beyond summarizing current knowledge, this work aims to establish a shared framework and define strategies for studying a variable IMF in the era of near-infrared integral-field spectroscopy, 30m-class telescopes and major space-based observatories.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate how discontinuities in the point spread function (PSF) and image noise affect weak gravitational lensing shear measurements. Our focus is on discontinuities that arise in coadded images, particularly when edges from input images cross the coadd region. Using Metacalibration and Metadetection for shear calibration and a simple weighted mean coaddition, we find no significant biases for typical galaxy populations, typical edge hit rates (a few percent), or coadds with tens to hundreds of input images. Biases exceeding requirements for large lensing surveys occur only in extreme conditions: (a) coadds with just two input images, (b) an image edge crosses the object in about 25% of coadds, (c) PSF size variations greater than 25%, and (d) relatively small galaxies. Even in these extreme cases, accurate shear recovery is achievable by identifying and removing problematic measurements. We use a simple statistic which quantifies the relative variation in PSF size across each object.

 - **Abstract**
 A semi-analytical model for the evolution of galaxies and supermassive black holes (SMBHs) within the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm has been shown to yield stellar mass-BH mass relations that reproduce both the JWST and pre-JWST observations. Either fuzzy or warm dark matter (FDM or WDM) would suppress the formation of the smaller galactic halos that play important roles in the CDM fit to the high-redshift SMBH data. Our analysis of the stellar mass-BH mass relation disfavours FDM fields with masses $< 2.0\times 10^{-20}$ eV and WDM particles with masses $< 7.2$ keV, both at the 95 % confidence level.
