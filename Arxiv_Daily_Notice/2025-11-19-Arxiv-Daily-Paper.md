 - **Abstract**
 Dust-continuum observations of many protoplanetary disks reveal rings and gaps that are widely interpreted as evidence of ongoing planet formation. Here we present the first framework for inferring planet and disk parameters from such images using variational autoencoder (VAE) based generative machine learning (ML). The new framework is called VADER (Variational Autoencoder for Disks with Embedded Rings). We train VADER on synthetic images of dust continuum emission, generated from \texttt{FARGO3D} hydrodynamic simulations post-processed with Monte Carlo radiative transfer calculations. VADER infers the masses of up to three embedded planets as well as the disk parameters viscous $\alpha$, dust-to-gas ratio, Stokes number, and flaring index. VADER returns a full posterior distribution for each of these quantities. We demonstrate that VADER reconstructs disk morphologies with high structural similarity (index $>$ 0.99), accurately recovers planet parameters with $R^2 > 0.9$ across planet masses, and reliably predicts disk parameters. Applied to ALMA dust continuum images of 23 protoplanetary disks, our model returns mass estimates for embedded planets of 0.3-2~$M_{\mathrm{Jup}}$ that agree to within $1\sigma$ of published values in most cases, and infers disk parameters consistent with current literature. Once trained, the VAE performs full posterior parameter inference in a matter of minutes, offering statistical rigor with enough computational speed for application to large-scale ALMA surveys. These results establish VAE-based models as powerful tools for inferring from disk structure the masses of embedded planets and the global disk parameters, with their associated uncertainties.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work we introduce the concept of self-interacting dark matter with scale-dependent equation of state, in the context of which dark matter is collisional and its equation of state is radius-dependent and has the form $P(r)=K(r)\left(\frac{\rho(r)}{\rho_{\star}}\right)^{\gamma(r)}$. We confronted the effectively 2-parameter model with 174 galaxies from the SPARC data, and we found that the rotation curves of 100 galaxies can be perfectly fitted by the model. These galaxies are dark matter dominated, mostly dwarfs, low-luminosity and low-surface-brightness spiral galaxies. We demonstrate that scale-dependent self-interacting dark matter solves the cusp-core issue for dark matter dominated galaxies. More importantly, the structure of the scale-dependent SIDM model produces in a semi-theoretically and semi-empirically way the canonical Tully-Fisher and the baryonic Tully-Fisher relations when these 100 viable dwarfs, low-surface-brightness and low-luminosity galaxies are taken into account. The behavior of the entropy function $K(r)$ is assumed to be $K(r)=K_0\times\left(1+\frac{r}{r_c}\right)^{-p}$. The perfect fits of the rotation curves come for a nearly isothermal and virialized dark matter halo, which naturally predicts the correlation $K_0\sim V_{\mathrm{max}}^2$. This correlation holds true empirically as confirmed by the data and we also find empirically $L\sim K_0^2$ from the data, thus the canonical Tully-Fisher relation is reproduced semi-theoretically and semi-empirically. We perform the same task and we find theoretically, for dark matter dominated galaxies, that $K_0\sim V_{\mathrm{flat}}^2$ which is also confirmed empirically from the data, along with the correlation $K_0\sim M_b^{0.5}$, hence the baryonic Tully-Fisher law naturally emerges in a semi-theoretical and semi-empirical manner.

 - **Abstract**
 Coronal holes (CHs) are low-activity, low-density solar coronal regions with open magnetic field lines (Cranmer 2009). In the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) spectrum, CHs appear as dark patches. Using daily hand-drawn maps from the Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC), we developed a semi-automated pipeline to digitize the SWPC maps into binary segmentation masks. The resulting masks constitute the CHASM-SWPC dataset, a high-quality dataset to train and test automated CH detection models, which is released with this paper. We developed CHASM (Coronal Hole Annotation using Semi-automatic Methods), a software tool for semi-automatic annotation that enables users to rapidly and accurately annotate SWPC maps. The CHASM tool enabled us to annotate 1,111 CH masks, comprising the CHASM-SWPC-1111 dataset. We then trained multiple CHRONNOS (Coronal Hole RecOgnition Neural Network Over multi-Spectral-data) architecture (Jarolim et al. 2021) neural networks using the CHASM-SWPC dataset and compared their performance. Training the CHRONNOS neural network on these data achieved an accuracy of 0.9805, a True Skill Statistic (TSS) of 0.6807, and an intersection-over-union (IoU) of 0.5668, which is higher than the original pretrained CHRONNOS model Jarolim et al. (2021) achieved an accuracy of 0.9708, a TSS of 0.6749, and an IoU of 0.4805, when evaluated on the CHASM-SWPC-1111 test set.

 - **Abstract**
 The Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) is a deep wide-field multi-band imaging survey consisting of three layers (Wide, Deep, and UltraDeep), with the Wide layer covering $\sim 1470$ deg$^2$ to a depth of $i \sim 26$ mag. We present the QHSC catalog, a machine-learning selected sample of quasar candidates with photometric redshifts in the Wide layer of the HSC-SSP survey (Public Data Release 3). The full QHSC catalog contains four distinct samples: a master sample with HSC-only photometry, an HSC+WISE sample, and two samples including near-infrared data from UKIDSS and VISTA, denoted as GoldenU and GoldenV. For each sample, an XGBoost classifier is trained and evaluated using independent spectroscopic test sets from HETDEX, VVDS, and zCOSMOS-bright. The numbers of quasar candidates in the QHSC catalog are 1,184,574 (master), 371,777 (HSC+WISE), 87,460 (GoldenU), and 120,572 (GoldenV), with respective completeness values of 85.3%, 92.7%, 89.8%, and 91.3%. We develop ensemble photometric redshift estimators based on bootstrap aggregating (bagging) of multiple XGBoost regressors, achieving outlier fractions of 21.7%, 13.1%, 9.5%, and 10.7% for these samples. The catalog provides quasar classification probabilities (p_QSO), enabling construction of purer subsamples via thresholding. This work offers a valuable resource for studies of quasars and cosmology, and highlights the effectiveness of machine learning for quasar selection in future wide and deep imaging surveys. The catalog is publicly available at this https URL.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the cosmological impact of ultralight dark matter (ULDM) with a quadratic coupling to Standard Model particles. In addition to the suppression of small-scale power from ULDM itself, the coupling induces a variation of fundamental constants that is modulated by the ULDM oscillatory field value. In this work, we consider the ULDM-induced, time-dependent variation of the fine structure constant and the mass of the electron. These variations modify the predicted abundance of light elements during Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) and the process of recombination, thereby affecting the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We use CMB anisotropy data and baryon acoustic oscillation measurements to obtain constraints on the variation of couplings over a wide range of ULDM masses. We self-consistently account for the modification of the primordial helium abundance during BBN in computing the CMB power spectra. We find that the allowed ULDM fraction of total dark matter abundance is more constrained for ULDM masses $\lesssim 10^{-26}~\mathrm{eV}$ in the presence of the variations. Moreover, our constraints on the variational couplings for ULDM masses $\lesssim 10^{-27}~\mathrm{eV}$ are stronger than the ones derived from the primordial helium abundance at BBN. Under our ULDM model, the variation of fundamental constants has no appreciable impact on the Hubble constant inferred from CMB data and thus does not present a viable solution to the Hubble tension.

 - **Abstract**
 As the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) approaches operational status, optimising its imaging performance is critical. A differential piston, arising from either the adaptive optics (AO) control loop, thermomechanical effects, or other sources, significantly degrades the image quality and is detrimental to the telescope's overall performance. In a numerical simulation set-up, we propose a method for estimating the differential piston between the petals of the ELT's M4 mirror using images from a 2x2 Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor (SH-WFS), commonly used in the ELT's tomographic AO mode. We aim to identify the limitations of this approach by evaluating its sensitivity to various observing conditions and sources of noise. Using a deep learning model based on a ResNet architecture, we trained a neural network (NN) on simulated datasets to estimate the differential piston. We assessed the robustness of the method under various conditions, including variations in Strehl ratio, polychromaticity, and detector noise. The performance was quantified using the root mean square error (RMSE) of the estimated differential piston aberration. This method demonstrates the ability to extract differential piston information from 2x2 SH-WFS images. Temporal averaging of frames makes the differential piston signal emerge from the turbulence-induced speckle field and leads to a significant improvement in the RMSE calculation. As expected, better seeing conditions result in improved accuracy. Polychromaticity only degrades the performance by less than 5% compared to the monochromatic case. In a realistic scenario, detector noise is not a limiting factor, as the primary limitation rather arises from the need for sufficient speckle averaging. The network was also shown to be applicable to input images other than the 2x2 SH-WFS data.

 - **Abstract**
 High-resolution mapping of cosmic mass distribution is essential for a variety of astrophysical applications including understanding cosmic structure formation, and galaxy formation and evolution. However dark matter is not directly observed and therefore we need advanced methods for solving inverse problems to reconstruct the underlying cosmic matter distribution. Here, we train a generative diffusion model and use it in the Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS) framework to reconstruct mass maps from Dark Energy Survey-Year 3 (DES-Y3) weak gravitational lensing data at high (1 arcminute) resolution. We show that the standard DPS results are biased, but they can be easily corrected by scaling the log-likelihood score during the diffusion process, yielding unbiased results with proper uncertainty quantification. The resulting mass maps reveal cosmic structures with enhanced detail, opening the door for improved astrophysical studies using the obtained mass maps.
#### Equilateral non-Gaussian Bias at the Field Level

 - **Abstract**
 Primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) is a common prediction of a wide class of inflationary models. Equilateral-type PNG, generically predicted by single-field inflationary models with higher-derivative interactions, imprints subtle but measurable signatures on the large-scale distribution of matter. An important parameter of these imprints is the PNG-induced bias coefficient $b_\psi$, which quantifies how the abundance and clustering of dark matter halos and galaxies respond to mode coupling in the initial conditions. Measuring $b_\psi$ is important for constraining equilateral PNG, yet it is notoriously challenging due to its degeneracy with Gaussian scale-dependent bias contributions. In this work, we present the first precision measurements of equilateral $b_\psi$ for dark matter halos using effective field theory at the field level. We show that this approach disentangles PNG effects from those of the Gaussian bias by virtue of noise variance cancellation. We compare our results with the phenomenological predictions based on the Peak-Background Split model, finding some agreement at the qualitative level on the redshift and mass dependence, but poor agreement at the quantitative level. We present a fitting formula for $b_\psi$ as a function of the linear bias, which can be used to set priors in PNG searches with ongoing and future galaxy surveys.
