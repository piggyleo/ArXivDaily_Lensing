 - **Abstract**
 The spatial extent of the environment's impact on galaxies marks a transitional region between cluster and field galaxies. We present a data-driven method to identify this region in galaxy clusters with masses $M_{200\rm ,mean}>10^{13} M_{\odot}$ at $z = 0$. Using resolved galaxy samples from the largest simulation volume of IllustrisTNG (TNG300-1), we examine how galaxy properties vary as a function of distance to the closest cluster. We train neural networks to classify galaxies into cluster and field galaxies based on their intrinsic properties. Using this classifier, we present the first quantitative and probabilistic map of the transition region. It is represented as a broad and intrinsically scattered region near cluster outskirts, rather than a sharp physical boundary. This is the physical detection of a mixed population. In order to determine transition regions of different physical processes by training property-specific models, we categorise galaxy properties based on their underlying physics, i.e. gas, stellar, and dynamical. Changes to the dynamical properties dominate the innermost regions of the clusters of all masses. Stellar properties and gas properties, on the other hand, exhibit transitions at similar locations for low mass clusters, yet gas properties have transitions in the outermost regions for high mass clusters. These results have implications for cluster environmental studies in both simulations and observations, particularly in refining the definition of cluster boundaries while considering environmental preprocessing and how galaxies evolve under the effect of the cluster environment.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an overview of the JWST GLIMPSE program, highlighting its survey design, primary science goals, gravitational lensing models, and first results. GLIMPSE provides ultra-deep JWST/NIRCam imaging across seven broadband filters (F090W, F115W, F200W, F277W, F356W, F444W) and two medium-band filters (F410M, F480M), with exposure times ranging from 20 to 40 hours per filter. This yields a 5$\sigma$ limiting magnitude of 30.9 AB (measured in a 0.2 arcsec diameter aperture). The field is supported by extensive ancillary data, including deep HST imaging from the Hubble Frontier Fields program, VLT/MUSE spectroscopy, and deep JWST/NIRSpec medium-resolution multi-object spectroscopy. Exploiting the strong gravitational lensing of the galaxy cluster Abell S1063, GLIMPSE probes intrinsic depths beyond 33 AB magnitudes and covers an effective source-plane area of approximately 4.4 arcmin$^2$ at $z \sim 6$. The program's central aim is to constrain the abundance of the faintest galaxies from $z \sim 6$ up to the highest redshifts, providing crucial benchmarks for galaxy formation models, which have so far been tested primarily on relatively bright systems. We present an initial sample of $\sim 540$ galaxy candidates identified at $6 < z < 16$, with intrinsic UV magnitudes spanning $M_{\mathrm UV}$ = $-$20 to $-$12. This enables unprecedented constraints on the extreme faint end of the UV luminosity function at these epochs. In addition, GLIMPSE opens new windows for spatially resolved studies of star clusters in early galaxies and the detection and characterization of faint high-$z$ active galactic nuclei. This paper accompanies the first public data release, which includes reduced JWST and HST mosaics, photometric catalogs, and gravitational lensing models.
#### Chemical dissection of merger-induced $m=1$ lopsidedness in Milky Way-like galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 The Milky Way harbours a prominent m=1 lopsided distortion in both stellar and neutral gas distributions. On the other hand, chemo-dynamical studies have been proven to be effective in grasping the overall evolution of galaxies. Here, we investigate systematically the excitation and evolution of a merger-driven $m=1$ lopsidedness in a Milky Way (MW)-like host galaxy, as a function of chemical distribution of stars. Using seven dissipationless, high-resolution $N$-body simulations of minor mergers (between a MW-like host and a satellite) under varying orbital configurations (prograde/retrograde and different orientation of the satellite orbital plane), we first show that a tidal interaction excites a prominent $m=1$ lopsidedness in the stellar density and velocity distribution of the MW-like host. Assigning, a posteriori, metallicities to stellar particles of the MW-like host based on the current observational constraints, we sub-divide the stars into metal-rich ([Fe/H] > 0), metal-intermediate (-0.5 < [Fe/H] <0), and metal-poor (- 0.5 < [Fe/H]) populations. We demonstrate that metal-rich population always show a much stronger $m=1$ lopsidedness in both density and velocity distributions when compared to other two populations. This trend holds true for all minor merger model considered here, regardless of their orbital configurations. Furthermore, minor merger also triggers a transient off-centred stellar disc-dark matter halo configuration, with metal-rich population showing the highest degree of disc-halo offset. We show that the metal-rich population which is kinematically colder (i.e. lower velocity dispersion) by construction, is more susceptible to external perturbations. Lastly, using a catalogue of photometry and metalicity for the LMC, we show that the strength of the $m=1$ distortion (predominantly in the form of an one-arm spiral) in stars increases with metallicity as well.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutron stars (NSs) provide a unique laboratory to probe dark matter (DM) through its gravitational imprint on stellar evolution. We use a two-fluid framework with non-annihilating, asymmetric DM, both fermionic and bosonic, that interacts with ordinary matter (OM) solely through gravity. Within this framework, we track proto-neutron stars (PNSs) across their thermal and compositional evolution via quasi-static modeling over the Kelvin--Helmholtz cooling timescale. We uncover a distinct thermal signature: DM cores deepen the gravitational potential, compressing and heating the baryonic matter, while extended DM halos provide external support, leading to cooling of the stellar matter. In contrast, hyperons and other exotic baryons soften the equation of state similarly to DM cores but reduce, rather than increase, the temperature. DM thus alters both temperature and particle distribution profiles in ways that provide a clear diagnostic of its presence. DM cores also enhance compactness and shift hyperon onset, with the strongest effects during deleptonization and neutrino-transparent phases due to reduced neutrino pressure contributions. Consequently, this early thermal evolution, observable through supernova neutrino light curves and young pulsar cooling curves, offers a direct, testable probe of DM in NSs.

 - **Abstract**
 To validate key technologies for wide field-of-view (FOV) X-ray polarization measurements, the Cosmic X-ray Polarization Detector (CXPD) CubeSat series has been developed as a prototype platform for the Low-Energy Xray Polarization Detector (LPD) onboard the POLAR-2 mission. The wide-FOV design significantly increases the complexity of the background environment, posing notable challenges for real-time gamma-ray burst (GRB) identification. In this work, we propose an in-orbit GRB identification method based on machine learning, using simulated spectral data as input. A training dataset was constructed using a Geant4-based simulator, incorporating in-orbit background and GRB events modeled within the 2-10 keV energy range. To meet the computational constraints of onboard processing, we employ a multimodal large language model (MLLM), which is fine-tuned using low-rank adaptation (LoRA) based on miniCPM-V2.6 and quantized to 4-bit precision. The model achieves perfect classification accuracy on validation data and demonstrates strong regression performance in estimating GRB spectral indices, with an RMSE of 0.118. Furthermore, we validate the feasibility of onboard deployment through a simulated satellite data processing pipeline, highlighting the potential of our approach to enable future real-time GRB detection and spectral analysis in orbit.

 - **Abstract**
 Flexible and accurate interpolation schemes using machine learning could be of great benefit for many use-cases in numerical simulations and post-processing, such as temporal upsampling or storage reduction. In this work, we adapt the physics-informed token transformer (PITT) network for multi-channel data and couple it with Fourier neural operator (FNO). The resulting PITT FNO network is trained for interpolation tasks on a dataset governed by the Euler equations. We compare the performance of our machine learning model with a linear interpolation baseline and show that it requires $\sim6-10$ times less data to achieve the same mean square error of the interpolated quantities. Additionally, PITT FNO has excellent mass and energy conservation as a result of its physics-informed nature. We further discuss the ability of the network to recover fine detail using a spectral analysis. Our results suggest that loss of fine details is related to the decreasing correlation time of the data with increasing Fourier mode which cannot be resolved by simply increasing Fourier mode truncation in FNO.
#### Euclid preparation. Non-Gaussianity of 2-point statistics likelihood: Precise analysis of the matter power spectrum distribution

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the non-Gaussian features in the distribution of the matter power spectrum multipoles. Using the COVMOS method, we generate 100\,000 mock realisations of dark matter density fields in both real and redshift space across multiple redshifts and cosmological models. We derive an analytical framework linking the non-Gaussianity of the power spectrum distribution to higher-order statistics of the density field, including the trispectrum and pentaspectrum. We explore the effect of redshift-space distortions, the geometry of the survey, the Fourier binning, the integral constraint, and the shot noise on the skewness of the distribution of the power spectrum measurements. Our results demonstrate that the likelihood of the estimated matter power spectrum deviates significantly from a Gaussian assumption on nonlinear scales, particularly at low redshift. This departure is primarily driven by the pentaspectrum contribution, which dominates over the trispectrum at intermediate scales. We also examine the impact of the finiteness of the survey geometry in the context of the Euclid mission and find that both the shape of the survey and the integral constraint amplify the skewness.
#### A Strong Gravitational Lensing Model of PSZ2 G118.46+39.32

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first strong gravitational lensing model for the cluster PSZ2 G118.46+39.32 (z = 0.3967) using new NIRCam imaging from the Strong LensIng and Cluster Evolution (SLICE) JWST program. We leverage the broad coverage of the SLICE ultrawide JWST filters to identify new lensed galaxies, some of which are not visible in HST, to model the cluster's mass distribution. The model was constructed with a total of 11 multiply imaged systems, decomposed into 30 images with 60 clumps used as strong lensing constraints. PSZ2 G118.46+39.32 shows a clear bimodal structure, indicating that it may be undergoing a merger. The predicted mass distribution of the model aligns with the X-ray gas in the cluster, suggesting it is in a pre-merger state.

 - **Abstract**
 Connecting the formation and evolution of galaxies to the large-scale structure is crucial for interpreting cosmological observations. While hydrodynamical simulations accurately model the correlated properties of galaxies, they are computationally prohibitive to run over volumes that match modern surveys. We address this by developing a framework to rapidly generate mock galaxy catalogs conditioned on inexpensive dark-matter-only simulations. We present a multi-modal, transformer-based model that takes 3D dark matter density and velocity fields as input, and outputs a corresponding point cloud of galaxies with their physical properties. We demonstrate that our trained model faithfully reproduces a variety of galaxy summary statistics and correctly captures their variation with changes in the underlying cosmological and astrophysical parameters, making it the first accelerated forward model to capture all the relevant galaxy properties, their full spatial distribution, and their conditional dependencies in hydrosimulations.
#### Accelerated inference of microlensed gravitational waves with machine learning

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational waves (GWs) propagating through the universe can be microlensed by stellar and intermediate-mass objects. Lensing induces frequency-dependent amplification of GWs, which can be computed using \texttt{GLoW}, an accurate code suitable for evaluating this factor for generic lens models and arbitrary impact parameters depending on the lens configuration. For parameter inference, we employ the DINGO algorithm, a machine learning framework based on neural posterior estimation, a simulation-based inference method that uses normalizing flows to efficiently approximate posterior distributions of the physical parameters. As a proof-of-principle, we demonstrate that it enables efficient parameter estimation of diffracted GW signals using an isolated point mass lens model. This method can be useful for rapidly identifying microlensed events within large GW catalogs and for conducting population studies of compact binaries. Compared to traditional parameter estimation techniques, we find that combining DINGO with importance sampling can provide efficient estimation of the background Bayes-factor distribution, which is required in evaluating the significance of candidate lensed events. However, for foreground (lensed) events, care must be taken, as sampling efficiency can decrease when the lensed data lie outside the distribution learned by the unlensed DINGO network. Our framework can be naturally extended to more complex and realistic lens models, allowing detailed analyses of the microlensed GWs.
#### Dark winds on the horizon: Prospects for detecting neutrino and hot dark matter wakes in large-scale structure

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08574

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.08574

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the cosmological signatures of neutrino and Hot Dark Matter (HDM) wakes, which refers to the preferential accumulation of neutrinos (or, more broadly, HDM particles) downstream of moving cold dark matter structures. We improve on existing theoretical models, and provide forecasts for the detectability of the effect in future surveys under more realistic conditions than previously considered in the literature. We show that neutrino and HDM wakes are unlikely to be ever observed with the most natural tracer of a hot subcomponent of the total dark matter on cosmological scales, i.e. 2D weak lensing surveys. However, the effect can be detected at a high significance with idealistic 3D maps of a tracer of HDM, for sufficiently small values of the effective free-streaming length (e.g. present-day values of $k_{\textrm{fs},0} \gtrsim 0.1\textrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ to reach $\textrm{SNR} \gtrsim 1$, for a HDM species accounting for a percent of the total dark matter). HDM wakes are a smoking gun of the effects of free-streaming, which cannot be mimicked by changes to the background expansion history (such as allowing for the dark energy to be dynamical), and hence offer another avenue to search for massive neutrinos, and hot subcomponents of the total dark matter more broadly, in a way that complements traditional observables.
