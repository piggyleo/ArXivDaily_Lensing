#### Disk Formation and the Size-sSFR Relation of Dwarf Galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 Dwarf galaxies are dark matter-dominated systems that are sensitive to feedback and display a diversity of baryonic morphologies. This makes them excellent probes for understanding dark matter and galaxy evolution. This work investigates the physical processes that influence the sizes of isolated dwarf galaxies using high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations of $39$ dwarf galaxies drawn from the Marvelous Massive Dwarfs simulation suite ($7.5 < \log(M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) < 9.1$). Our simulations show that dwarf galaxies initially form as compact galaxies ($R_e < 2$ kpc). However, several of these galaxies ($54\%$) experience periods of gradual size growth at relatively stable sSFR, allowing them to become extended galaxies. We find that the growth of rotation-supported stellar disks is the primary means by which isolated dwarfs become extended in size. These stellar disks are formed by mergers with high orbital angular momentum satellites on high angular momentum (spiraling-in) orbits, which spin up the gas surrounding the central galaxy and contribute $\approx 30 \%$ of the cold gas mass at $z=0$. For these systems, star formation in the angular momentum supported gas and the gradual build up of stars in the disk result in secular size growth.

 - **Abstract**
 AGN jets are thought to be vital ingredients in galaxy evolution through the action of kinetic feedback; however, how narrow, relativistic outflows couple to galaxies remains an open question. Jet deceleration, which is often attributed to the entrainment of material, such as stellar winds, is thought to be necessary for efficient coupling. We present a simple model of jet deceleration due to stellar mass-loading to investigate the energy budget of direct jet feedback in the local Universe. To this end, we produce models of stellar mass-loss, including deriving a prescription for main sequence mass-loss rates as a function of stellar population age. We pair this mass-loss data with a parametric fit for radio AGN incidence, predicting that a majority of jets are decelerated within their hosts, and generally replicate the expected FR-II fraction in LERGs. We calculate that $\gtrsim$25\% of the jet power in the local Universe is efficiently decelerated and available for direct feedback within galaxies for any stellar population age. This fraction is largely invariant to the shape of the radio AGN incidence function at low jet Eddington fractions. The stellar mass-loss rate evolves significantly over time, approximately following $\tau^{-1.1}$, leading to corresponding decreases in decelerated jet power in older stellar populations. Although asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars dominate mass-loss at all ages, we find that their stochasticity is important in low-mass galaxies, and derive a critical jet power below which main sequence stars alone are sufficient to decelerate the jet.
#### IrisML: Neural Posterior Estimation for the Spectral Energy Distribution fitting

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26964

 - **Abstract**
 Over the past 30 years, numerous large-scale photometric astronomical surveys have been conducted, including SDSS, Pan-STARRS, Gaia,2MASS, WISE, and others. These surveys provide extensive photometric measurements that can be used to infer a wide range of physical parameters of astronomical objects. Traditionally, Bayesian approaches, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling have been employed for such inference tasks. However, these methods tend to be computationally intensive and often require manual tuning or expert supervision. In this work, we propose a novel machine learning model designed to perform automatic and robust inference from photometric data, offering a scalable and efficient alternative to conventional techniques.
#### Direct multi-model dark-matter search with gravitational-wave interferometers using data from the first part of the fourth LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational-wave detectors can probe the existence of dark matter with exquisite sensitivity. Here, we perform a search for three kinds of dark matter -- dilatons (spin-0), dark photons (spin-1) and tensor bosons (spin-2) -- using three independent methods on the first part of the most recent data from the fourth observing run of LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA. Each form of dark matter could have interacted with different standard-model particles in the instruments, causing unique differential strains on the interferometers. While we do not find any evidence for a signal, we place the most stringent upper limits to-date on each of these models. For scalars with masses between $[4\times 10^{-14},1.5\times 10^{-13}]$ eV that couple to photons or electrons, our constraints improve upon those from the third observing run by one order of magnitude, with the tightest limit of $\sim 10^{-20}\,\text{GeV}^{-1}$ at a mass of $\sim2\times 10^{-13}\text{ eV}$. For vectors with masses between $[7\times 10^{-13},8.47\times 10^{-12}]$ eV that couple to baryons, our constraints supersede those from MICROSCOPE and Eöt-Wash by one to two orders of magnitude, reaching a minimum of $\sim 5\times 10^{-24}$ at a mass of $\sim 10^{-12}$ eV. For tensors with masses of $[4\times 10^{-14},8.47\times 10^{-12}]$ eV (the full mass range analyzed) that couple via a Yukawa interaction, our constraints surpass those from fifth-force experiments by four to five orders of magnitude, achieving a limit as low as $\sim 8\times 10^{-9}$ at $\sim2\times 10^{-13}$ eV. Our results show that gravitational-wave interferometers have become frontiers for new physics and laboratories for direct multi-model dark-matter detection.

 - **Abstract**
 Photo-z algorithms that utilize SED template fitting have matured, and are widely adopted for use on high-redshift near-infrared data that provides a unique window into the early universe. Alternative photo-z methods have been developed, largely within the context of low-redshift optical surveys. Machine learning based approaches have gained footing in this regime, including those that utilize raw pixel information instead of aperture photometry. However, the efficacy of image-based algorithms on high-redshift, near-infrared data remains underexplored. Here, we test the performance of Detection, Instance Segmentation and Classification with Deep Learning (DeepDISC) on photometric redshift estimation with NIRCam images from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) program. DeepDISC is designed to produce probabilistic photometric redshift estimates directly from images, after detecting and deblending sources in a scene. Using NIRCam-only images and a compiled catalog of spectroscopic redshifts, we show that DeepDISC produces reliable photo-zs and uncertainties comparable to those estimated from template fitting using HST+JWST filters; DeepDISC even outperforms template fitting (lower scatter/fewer outliers) when the input photometric filters are matched. Compared with template fitting, DeepDISC does not require measured photometry from images, and can produce a catalog of 94000 photo-zs in ~4 minutes on a single NVIDIA A40 GPU. While current spectroscopic training samples are small and incomplete in color-magnitude space, this work demonstrates the potential of DeepDISC for increasingly larger image volumes and spectroscopic samples from ongoing and future programs. We discuss the impact of the training data on applications to broader samples and produce a catalog of photo-zs for all JADES DR2 photometric sources in the GOOD-S field, with quality flags indicating caveats.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.27050

 - **Abstract**
 Radiative transfer calculations are essential for modeling planetary atmospheres. However, standard methods are computationally demanding and impose accuracy-speed trade-offs. High computational costs force numerical simplifications in large models (e.g., General Circulation Models) that degrade the accuracy of the simulation. Radiative transfer calculations are an ideal candidate for machine learning emulation: fundamentally, it is a well-defined physical mapping from a static atmospheric profile to the resulting fluxes, and high-fidelity training data can be created from first principles calculations. We developed a radiative transfer emulator using an encoder-only transformer neural network architecture, trained on 1D profiles representative of solar-composition hot Jupiter atmospheres. Our emulator reproduced bolometric two-stream layer fluxes with mean test set errors of ~1% compared to the traditional method and achieved speedups of 100x. Emulating radiative transfer with machine learning opens up the possibility for faster and more accurate routines within planetary atmospheric models such as GCMs.

 - **Abstract**
 Objective: ServiMon is designed to offer a scalable and intelligent pipeline for data collection and auditing to monitor distributed astronomical systems such as the ASTRI Mini-Array. The system enhances quality control, predictive maintenance, and real-time anomaly detection for telescope operations. Methods: ServiMon integrates cloud-native technologies-including Prometheus, Grafana, Cassandra, Kafka, and InfluxDB-for telemetry collection and processing. It employs machine learning algorithms, notably Isolation Forest, to detect anomalies in Cassandra performance metrics. Key indicators such as read/write latency, throughput, and memory usage are continuously monitored, stored as time-series data, and preprocessed for feature engineering. Anomalies detected by the model are logged in InfluxDB v2 and accessed via Flux for real-time monitoring and visualization. Results: AI-based anomaly detection increases system resilience by identifying performance degradation at an early stage, minimizing downtime, and optimizing telescope operations. Additionally, ServiMon supports astrostatistical analysis by correlating telemetry with observational data, thus enhancing scientific data quality. AI-generated alerts also improve real-time monitoring, enabling proactive system management. Conclusion: ServiMon's scalable framework proves effective for predictive maintenance and real-time monitoring of astronomical infrastructures. By leveraging cloud and edge computing, it is adaptable to future large-scale experiments, optimizing both performance and cost. The combination of machine learning and big data analytics makes ServiMon a robust and flexible solution for modern and next-generation observational astronomy.

 - **Abstract**
 Thermal emission spectra provide key insights into the atmospheric composition and especially the temperature structure of an exoplanet. With broader wavelength coverage, sensitivity and higher resolution, JWST has enabled robust constraints on these properties, including detections of photochemical products. This advances the need for retrieval frameworks capable of navigating complex parameter spaces for accurate data interpretation. In this work, we introduce the emission retrieval module of NEXOTRANS, which employs both one- and two-stream radiative transfer approximations and leverages Bayesian and machine learning techniques for retrievals. It also incorporates approximate disequilibrium chemistry models to infer photochemical species like SO2. We applied NEXOTRANS to the JWST NIRCam and MIRI emission observations of WASP-69b, covering the 2-12 microns range. The retrievals place robust constraints on the volume mixing ratios (VMR) of H2O, CO2, CO, CH4, and potential SO2. The best-fit model, i.e, free chemistry combined with non-uniform aerosol coverage, yields a log(VMR) = -3.78 (+0.15/-0.17) for H2O and -5.77 (+0.09/-0.10) for CO2 which has a sharp absorption at 4.3 micron. The second best-fit model, the hybrid equilibrium chemistry (utilizing equilibrium chemistry-grids) combined with non-uniform aerosol yields a C/O of 0.42 (+0.17/-0.13) and a metallicity of log[M/H] = 1.24 (+0.17/-0.14), corresponding to approximately 17.38 times the solar value. This hybrid chemistry retrieval also constrain SO2 with a log(VMR) = -4.85 (+0.28/-0.29), indicating possible absorption features in the 7-8 microns range. These results highlight NEXOTRANS's capability to significantly advance JWST emission spectra interpretation, offering broader insights into exoplanetary atmospheres.
#### Reproducing Abell 2744 with the HyperMillennium Simulation

 - **Abstract**
 We present the Hyper Millennium (HM) simulation, an extremely large cosmological simulation designed to support next-generation galaxy surveys. The simulation follows 4.2 trillion dark matter particles in a comoving box of $2.5\ h^{-1}{\rm Gpc}$, with a mass resolution of $3.2 \times 10^8\, {\rm M}_{\odot}$ and a force resolution of $3.0\ h^{-1}{\rm kpc}$. Its combination of scale and resolution is ideal for studying large-scale structures and rare cosmic objects. In this first paper of the HM project, we explore whether the massive galaxy cluster Abell 2744 (A2744) can be reproduced in detail in the simulation. Pixel-based statistics of galaxy number density $N_{\rm gal}$, luminosity density $L_{\rm gal}$, and projected mass density $\kappa$ show excellent agreement between A2744 and its analogues down to $\sim 50\ {\rm kpc}$, once field-selection biases toward high galaxy surface density are accounted for. This concordance, achieved in one of the most extreme known galaxy environments, is a validation of the underlying $\Lambda{\rm CDM}$ model in the extreme regime of A2744 and showcases the robustness and accuracy of the HM simulation, which is capable of producing galaxy and mass catalogues of comparable quality out to high redshift across its full comoving volume of $45$ ${\rm Gpc^3}$.
#### Ultra-diffuse Galaxy Analogues in the Subaru Hyper-Suprime Cam Wide-field Clusters

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.27459

 - **Abstract**
 We perform a systematic statistical study of ultra-diffuse galaxy analogues (NUDGEs) in a large sample of galaxy clusters to investigate their properties with respect to the host clusters. We used data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program wide field survey and find a total of 5057 NUDGEs exceeding the background counts in 51 out of 66 galaxy clusters. The clusters span the redshift range 0.08$\,<\,$z$\,<\,$0.15 and they have a mass range of $0.95\times10^{14}\,\text{M}_\odot - 8.34\times10^{14}\,\text{M}_\odot$. The properties of these NUDGEs are found to be similar to UDGs studied in previous works and reaffirm that they are an extension of a continuous galaxy distribution. The number of NUDGEs as a function of cluster halo mass for our sample follows the power law: $N\propto M_{200}^{0.78\pm\,0.28} $. This fit is consistent with previous UDG studies and, together with our NUDGE sizes distributions, matches well with the simulations of UDGs in cored dark matter haloes formed by tidal stripping. The NUDGE density distribution with respect to clustercentric radius of our sample is flatter than previous UDG studies, although the red NUDGEs in this sample show a statistically significant decrease in density with respect to clustercentric radius, indicating that red UDGs may be more affected by their environment than blue UDGs.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery of 52 eclipsing quadruple star candidates detected in TESS Full Frame Image eleanor data by machine learning and citizen scientists. The uniformly-vetted and -validated targets exhibit two sets of eclipses following two distinct periods, representing quadruple systems with a 2+2 hierarchical configuration. Detailed photocenter measurements confirmed that both sets of eclipses originate within ~0.1-0.2 pixels (~2-4 arcsec) of the corresponding target, and ruled out resolved nearby field stars. The catalog includes a number of systems producing prominent eclipse timing variations and/or apsidal motion, a quadruple with an outer period of ~1,400 days, and even a 2+2 quadruple in a likely wide quintuple with a resolved co-moving star. Additionally, two systems have complete astrometric solutions for the outer orbits from Gaia. We provide the measured ephemerides, eclipse depths and durations, overall statistical properties, and highlight potentially interesting systems that merit further investigations.
#### Revealing cosmological fluctuations in 21cm intensity maps with MeerKLASS: from maps to power spectra

 - **Abstract**
 Mapping the integrated 21cm emission line from dark matter-tracing neutral hydrogen gas is the primary science goal for MeerKLASS (MeerKAT's Large Area Synoptic Survey). Prior to the arrival of MeerKAT, this intensity mapping technique had only been tested on a couple of pre-existing single-dish radio telescopes with a handful of observational hours with which to make early pioneering detections. The 64-dish MeerKAT array, precursor to the Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO), can scan the sky in auto-correlation mode and perform intensity mapping across large sky areas, presenting the exciting potential for a wide-sky (${\gtrsim}\,10{,}000\,{\rm deg}^2$) spectroscopic survey across redshift $0.4\,{<}\,z\,{<}\,1.45$. Validating the auto-correlation (or single-dish) mode of observation for a multi-dish array and developing the analysis pipeline with which to make unbiased measurements has presented major challenges to this endeavour. In this work, we overview the advances in the field that have facilitated a robust analysis framework for single-dish intensity mapping, and review some results that showcase its success using early MeerKLASS surveys. We demonstrate our control of foreground cleaning, signal loss and map regridding to deliver detections of cosmological clustering within the intensity maps through cross-correlation power spectrum measurements with overlapping galaxy surveys. Finally, we discuss the prospects for future MeerKLASS observations and forecast its potential, making our code publicly available: this https URL.
#### DiffstarPop: A generative physical model of galaxy star formation history
 - **Authors:** Alex Alarcon, Andrew P. Hearin, Matthew R. Becker, Gillian Beltz-Mohrmann, Andrew Benson, Sachi Weerasooriya

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27604

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.27604

 - **Abstract**
 We present DiffstarPop, a differentiable forward model of cosmological populations of galaxy star formation histories (SFH). In the model, individual galaxy SFH is parametrized by Diffstar, which has parameters $\theta_{\rm SFH}$ that have a direct interpretation in terms of galaxy formation physics, such as star formation efficiency and quenching. DiffstarPop is a model for the statistical connection between $\theta_{\rm SFH}$ and the mass assembly history (MAH) of dark matter halos. We have formulated DiffstarPop to have the minimal flexibility needed to accurately reproduce the statistical distributions of galaxy SFH predicted by a diverse range of simulations, including the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulation, the Galacticus semi-analytic model, and the UniverseMachine semi-empirical model. Our publicly available code written in JAX includes Monte Carlo generators that supply statistical samples of galaxy assembly histories that mimic the populations seen in each simulation, and can generate SFHs for $10^6$ galaxies in 1.1 CPU-seconds, or 0.03 GPU-seconds. We conclude the paper with a discussion of applications of DiffstarPop, which we are using to generate catalogs of synthetic galaxies populating the merger trees in cosmological N-body simulations.
