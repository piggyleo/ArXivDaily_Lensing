 - **Abstract**
 We present new state-of-the-art lens models for strong gravitational lensing systems from the Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) survey, developed within a Bayesian framework that employs high-dimensional (pixellated), data-driven priors for the background source, foreground lens light, and point-spread function (PSF). Unlike conventional methods, our approach delivers high-resolution reconstructions of all major physical components of the lensing system and substantially reduces model-data residuals compared to previous work. For the majority of 30 lensing systems analyzed, we also provide posterior samples capturing the full uncertainty of each physical model parameter. The reconstructions of the background sources reveal high significance morphological structures as small as 200 parsecs in galaxies at redshifts of z 0.5-1.0, demonstrating the power of strong lensing and the analysis method to be used as a cosmic telescope to study the high redshift universe. This study marks the first application of data-driven generative priors to modeling real strong-lensing data and establishes a new benchmark for strong lensing precision modeling in the era of large-scale imaging surveys.
#### Connecting clustering and the cosmic web:Observational constraints on secondary halo bias

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmological simulations predict significant secondary dependencies of halo clustering on internal properties and environment. Detecting these subtle signals in observational data remains challenging, with important ramifications for galaxy evolution and cosmology. We probe secondary halo bias in observational survey data, using galaxy groups as dark matter halo proxies. We quantify secondary bias using central galaxy colour and environmental diagnostics. We use an extended, refined galaxy group catalogue from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Secondary bias is defined as any deviation in group clustering strength at fixed mass, quantified through the projected two-point correlation function. Our environmental analysis uses DisPerSE to compute distances to critical points of the density field, incorporating local group overdensity measurements on multiple scales. We robustly detect several forms of secondary bias in the clustering of galaxy groups. At fixed mass, groups hosting red central galaxies are more strongly clustered than those with blue centrals, with $b_{\rm relative}$ ranging from $\sim 1.2$ for the 15\% reddest centrals to $\sim 0.8$ for the bluest ones. Environmental dependencies based on cosmic-web distances are also present, though significantly weaker and largely mass-independent. The strongest signal arises from local overdensity: groups in the densest 15\% of environments reach $b_{\rm relative} \sim 1.4$, while those in the least dense regions fall to $b_{\rm relative} \sim 0.7$. These results establish a clear observational hierarchy for secondary halo bias. The colour of central galaxies correlates with the local group overdensity, which, in turn, correlates with the bias at fixed group mass. Assuming that central galaxy colour traces halo assembly history, this three-stage picture offers a conceptual link between our results and halo assembly bias.
#### SE3D: Building a radiative transfer emulator to fit panchromatic resolved galaxy observations with 3D models of dust and stars
 - **Authors:** Steven Ramnichal, Junkai Zhang, Stijn Wuyts, Cheng Li
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19623

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.19623

 - **Abstract**
 We present a framework for analysing panchromatic and spatially resolved galaxy observations, dubbed SE3D. SE3D simultaneously and self-consistently models a galaxy's spectral energy distribution and its spectral distributions of global structural parameters: the wavelength-dependent galaxy size, light profile and projected axis ratio. To this end, it employs a machine learning emulator trained on a large library of toy model galaxies processed with 3D dust radiative transfer and mock-observed under a range of viewing angles. The toy models vary in their stellar and dust geometries, and include radial stellar population gradients. The computationally efficient machine learning emulator uses a Bayesian neural network architecture, and reproduces the spectral distributions at an accuracy of ~ 0.05 dex or less across the dynamic range of input parameters, and across the rest-frame UVJ colour space spanned by observed galaxies. We carry out a sensitivity analysis demonstrating that the emulator has successfully learned the intricate mappings between galaxy physical properties and direct observables (fluxes, colours, sizes, size ratios between different wavebands, ...). We further discuss the physical conditions giving rise to a range of total-to-selective attenuation ratios, Rv, with among them most prominently the projected dust surface mass density.
#### Internal kinematics of dwarf galaxies orbitally moving in ultralight dark matter
 - **Authors:** E. V. Gorbar, A. I. Momot
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19692

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.19692

 - **Abstract**
 For dwarf galaxies modeled as deformed Plummer spheres and orbitally moving in ultralight dark matter halo of the Milky Way, the torque induced by the dynamical friction force is determined. The impact of this torque, as well as the torque produced by the gravitational force of the Milky Way, on the internal kinematics of dwarf galaxies is studied. Possible oscillations of dwarf galaxies caused by the tidal torque and misalignment of dwarf galaxies with respect to their equilibrium position are investigated and the corresponding frequencies and periods of oscillations are found.
#### Cold Dark Matter and Dark Energy Based on an Analogy with Superconductivity

Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19802

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.19802

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel candidate for cold dark matter consisting of condensed Cooper pairs in a theory of interacting fermions with broken chiral symmetry. Establishing the thermal history from the early radiation era to the present, the fermions are shown to behave like standard radiation at high temperatures, but then experience a critical era decaying faster than radiation, akin to freeze-out that sets the relic abundance. Through a second-order phase transition, fermion - antifermion pairs condense and the system asymptotes towards zero temperature and pressure. By the present era, the non-relativistic, massive condensate decays slightly faster than in the standard scenario -- a unique prediction that may be tested by combined measurements of the cosmic microwave background and large scale structure. We also show that in the case of massive fermions, the phase transition is frustrated, and freeze-out instead leaves a residual, long-lived

 - **Abstract**
 Properties of massive galaxy clusters, such as mass abundance and concentration, are sensitive to cosmology, making cluster statistics a powerful tool for cosmological studies. However, favoring a more simplified, spherically symmetric model for galaxy clusters can lead to biases in the estimates of cluster properties. In this work, we present a deep-learning approach for estimating the triaxiality and orientations of massive galaxy clusters (those with masses $\gtrsim 10^{14}\,M_\odot h^{-1}$) from 2D observables. We utilize the flagship hydrodynamical volume of the suite of cosmological-hydrodynamical MillenniumTNG (MTNG) simulations as our ground truth. Our model combines the feature extracting power of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and the message passing power of a graph neural network (GNN) in a multi-modal, fusion network. Our model is able to extract 3D geometry information from 2D idealized cluster multi-wavelength images (soft X-ray, medium X-ray, hard X-ray and tSZ effect) and mathematical graph representations of 2D cluster member observables (line-of-sight radial velocities, 2D projected positions and V-band luminosities). Our network improves cluster geometry estimation in MTNG by $30\%$ compared to assuming spherical symmetry. We report an $R^2 = 0.85$ regression score for estimating the major axis length of triaxial clusters and correctly classifying $71\%$ of prolate clusters with elongated orientations along our line-of-sight.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar flares, as one of the most prominent manifestations of solar activity, have a profound impact on both the Earth's space environment and human activities. As a result, accurate solar flare prediction has emerged as a central topic in space weather research. In recent years, substantial progress has been made in the field of solar flare forecasting, driven by the rapid advancements in space observation technology and the continuous improvement of data processing capabilities. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the current state of research in this area, with a particular focus on tracing the evolution of data-driven approaches -- which have progressed from early statistical learning techniques to more sophisticated machine learning and deep learning paradigms, and most recently, to the emergence of Multimodal Large Models (MLMs). Furthermore, this study examines the realistic performance of existing flare forecasting platforms, elucidating their limitations in operational space weather applications and thereby offering a practical reference for future advancements in technological optimization and system design.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a supervised machine learning classification of sources from the Javalambre Physics of the Accelerating Universe Astrophysical Survey (J-PAS) Pathfinder datasets: miniJPAS and J-NEP. Leveraging crossmatches with spectroscopic and photometric catalogs, we construct a robust labeled dataset comprising 14594 sources classified into extended (galaxies) and point-like (stars and quasars) objects. We assess dataset representativeness using UMAP analysis, confirming broad and consistent coverage of feature space. An XGBoost classifier, with hyperparameters tuned using automated optimization, is trained using purely photometric data (60-band J-PAS magnitudes) and combined photometric and morphological features, with performance thoroughly evaluated via ROC and purity-completeness metrics. Incorporating morphology significantly improves classification, outperforming the baseline classifications available in the catalogs. Permutation importance analysis reveals morphological parameters, particularly concentration, normalized peak surface brightness, and PSF, alongside photometric features around 4000 and 6900 A, as crucial for accurate classifications. We release a value-added catalog with our models for star-galaxy classification, enhancing the utility of miniJPAS and J-NEP for subsequent cosmological and astrophysical analyses.
#### Inferring the Impacts of Baryonic Feedback from Kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich Cross-Correlations

 - **Abstract**
 The complex processes of baryonic feedback associated with galaxy evolution are still poorly understood, and their impact on the clustering of matter on small scales remains difficult to quantify. While many fitting functions and emulators exist to model the matter power spectrum, their input parameters are not directly observable. However, recent studies using hydrodynamical simulations have identified a promising correlation between the gas content of halos and changes to the matter power spectrum from feedback. Building on these findings, we create the first fully data-driven power spectrum emulator. We utilize the kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) effect, a secondary anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background, as a tracer of free electrons in and around halos. We train a neural network to learn the mapping between the suppression of the matter power spectrum and the shape of the kSZ power spectrum extracted with a radial velocity template. We train and validate our algorithm using the FLAMINGO suite of hydrodynamical simulations, which encompasses a wide range of feedback models. Our emulator can reconstruct the matter power spectrum at the sub-percent level for scales $k\leq 5\;h/$Mpc and $0.2\leq z \leq 1.25$ directly from the data. Our model is robust and retains percent-level accuracy even for feedback models and cosmological parameter values not seen during training (except in a few extreme cases drastically different from the fiducial model). Due to its robustness, our algorithm offers a new way to identify the sources of suppression in the matter power spectrum, breaking the degeneracies between baryonic feedback and new physics. Finally, we present a forecast for reconstruction of the matter power spectrum combining maps of the microwave background anisotropies from a Simons Observatory-like experiment and galaxy catalogs from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument.
