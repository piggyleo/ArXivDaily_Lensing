 - **Abstract**
 In this work we continue our investigations of the possibility of explanation of the positron anomaly (PA) in cosmic rays with the help of annihilating or decaying dark matter (DM) component by varying its space distribution. In the contrast of our previous studies, where we first assumed some specific spatial distribution of DM component and looked at how it agrees with data, here we solve, in some sense, the inverse problem: we search for distribution, in a mathematical way, which satisfies observational data. A unique algorithm has been implemented which, using linear algebra and adaptive grid methods, adjusts distribution to the data. It allows telling in principle whether or not is possible to solve PA problem by variation of spatial distribution of DM sources. A positive result has been formally obtained. A class of solutions can be identified. Though the distributions obtained at the chosen injection spectra may seem slightly realistic, nonetheless it demonstrates a quite powerful possibility in explaining PA that could be realized in more realistic models.

 - **Abstract**
 The search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) commensal surveys aim to scan the sky to detect technosignatures from extraterrestrial life. A major challenge in SETI is the effective mitigation of radio frequency interference (RFI), a critical step that is particularly vital for the highly sensitive Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). While initial RFI mitigation (e.g., removal of persistent and drifting narrowband RFI) are essential, residual RFI often persists, posing significant challenges due to its complex and various nature. In this paper, we propose and apply an improved machine learning approach, the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm, to identify and mitigate residual RFI in FAST-SETI commensal survey archival data from July 2019. After initial RFI mitigation, we successfully identify and remove 36977 residual RFIs (accounting for $\sim$ 77.87\%) within approximately 1.678 seconds using the DBSCAN algorithm. This result shows that we have achieved a 7.44\% higher removal rate than previous machine learning methods, along with a 24.85\% reduction in execution time. We finally find interesting candidate signals consistent with previous studies, and retain one candidate signal following further analysis. Therefore, DBSCAN algorithm can mitigate more residual RFI with higher computational efficiency while preserving the candidate signals that we are interested in.
#### Milky Way disc & Bulge in situ populations: ESO white paper - Expanding horizons call

 - **Abstract**
 The formation and evolution of the Milky Way's disc, bar, and bulge remain fundamentally limited by the lack of a contiguous, Galaxy-wide, high-precision chemo-dynamical map. Key open questions - including the survival or destruction of the primitive discs, the origin of the bulge's multi-component structure, the role of mergers and secular processes, and the coupling between stellar chemistry, dynamics, and the Galactic potential - cannot be fully resolved with current or planned facilities. Existing spectroscopic surveys provide either high resolution for small samples or wide coverage at insufficient resolution and depth, and none can obtain homogeneous abundances, precise 3D kinematics, and reliable ages for the millions of stars required, particularly in the obscured midplane, the far side of the bar, or the outer, low-density disc. A new wide-field, massively multiplexed, large-aperture spectroscopic facility, capable of both high- and low-resolution spectroscopy over tens of thousands of square degrees, is therefore essential. Such a facility would deliver the statistical power, sensitivity, and completeness needed to reconstruct the Galaxy's assembly history, constrain its gravitational potential, and establish the Milky Way as the definitive benchmark for galaxy evolution.
#### The AIDA-TNG project: 3D halo shapes

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The shapes of dark matter halos can be used to constrain the fundamental properties of dark matter. In standard Cold Dark Matter (CDM) cosmologies, halos are typically triaxial, with a preference for prolate configurations, particularly at low masses and high redshift. Aims. We focus on the characterization of total matter 3D shape in alternative dark matter models, such as Self-Interacting Dark Matter (SIDM) and Warm Dark Matter (WDM). These scenarios predict different structural properties due to collisional effects or the suppression of small-scale power. Methods. We measure the different halo component shapes - dark matter, stars and gas - at various radii from the center in the AIDA-TNG (Alternative Interacting Dark Matter and Astrophysics - TNG), which is a suite of high-resolution cosmological simulations built upon the IllustrisTNG framework. The intent is to systematically study how different dark matter models - specifically, SIDM and WDM - affect galaxy formation and the structure of dark matter halos, when realistic baryonic physics is also included. Results. SIDM models tend to produce rounder and more isotropic halos, especially in the inner regions, as a result of momentum exchange between dark matter particles. WDM halos are also slightly more spherical than their CDM counterparts, and are typically less concentrated. In all cases, the inclusion of self-consistent baryonic physics makes the central regions of all halos rounder, while still revealing clear distinctions among the various dark matter models. Conclusions. The general framework presented in this work, based on the 3D halo shape, can be useful to interpret multi-wavelength data analyses of galaxies and clusters.
#### The AIDA-TNG project: dark matter profiles and concentrations in alternative dark matter models

 - **Abstract**
 In the standard Cold Dark Matter (CDM) scenario, the density profiles of dark matter haloes are well described by analytical models linking their concentration to halo mass. Alternative scenarios, such as warm dark matter (WDM) and self-interacting dark matter (SIDM), modify the inner structure of haloes and predict different profile shapes and central slopes. We employ the AIDA-TNG simulations to investigate how alternative dark matter physics and baryonic processes jointly shape the internal structure of haloes. Using dark-matter-only and full-physics runs, we measure the dark matter density profiles of haloes spanning six orders of magnitude in mass, from 10^9.5 Msun to 10^14.5 Msub, and characterise them with multiple analytical models. We provide the distribution of the best-fitting parameters, as well as the concentration-mass relation in WDM and SIDM. The Einasto profile well reproduces the inner flattening produced in WDM models, both in the collisionless and in the full-physics runs. In SIDM dark-matter-only runs, haloes are better described by explicitly cored profiles, with core sizes that depend on mass and on the self-interaction model. When baryons are included, the differences between CDM and SIDM decrease, and such large dark-matter cores no longer form because adiabatic contraction in the baryon-dominated region counteracts self-interactions. Nevertheless, the coupling between baryons and self-interactions induces a broader range of inner slopes, including cases that are steeper than CDM at Milky Way masses. Alternative dark matter physics thus leaves clear signatures in the inner halo structure, even if baryons significantly reshape these differences. Our results are useful for future studies that need to predict the properties of haloes in multiple dark matter models.
#### Dark Acoustic Oscillations as an Early-Universe Explanation of the DESI Anomaly

 - **Abstract**
 DESI DR2 data have been widely interpreted as evidence for late-time evolving dark energy (DE) with an apparent phantom crossing. Here we investigate an alternative explanation, based on early-Universe physics. If dark acoustic oscillations (DAO) are close in scale to baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), they can bias the extraction of the BAO scale from the peak in the galaxy correlation function. This leads to an apparent shift in the inferred distance if the superposition of BAO and DAO features is misinterpreted as being due to BAO only. Taking this shift into account, we find that a DAO with percent-level amplitude can reconcile DESI DR2 with Planck 2018 as well as Pantheon+ supernovae data, with fit improvement at a similar level as compared to evolving DE. Notably, a DAO feature with the required properties has been predicted in a previously proposed scenario that resolves the Hubble tension via a pre-recombination decoupling of dark matter and dark radiation (DRMD). The presence of a DAO feature close to the BAO peak can be scrutinized with future full-shape galaxy clustering data from DESI and Euclid.
#### Cored galaxies in cuspy dark matter halos

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate constraints on the inner stellar density profile from photometric data of dwarf spheroidal and ultra-faint dwarf galaxies. Our aim is to clarify under what conditions cored stellar profiles require dark matter halos that are also cored, deviating from the cuspy profiles expected for cold dark matter halos. We consider a variety of spherically symmetric stellar profiles, which we classify as "strong" or "weak" cores and cusps according to the behavior of the slope ($b_0$) and logarithmic slope ($\gamma_0$) at their centers. We explore which profiles lead to unphysical negative distribution functions when embedded in a cuspy halo, treating isotropic and anisotropic kinematics separately. We find that weakly-cored stellar profiles in 3D (i.e., $b_0 \neq 0$, $\gamma_0=0$) can be consistent with cuspy dark matter profiles, but strong 3D cores ($b_0=\gamma_0=0$) are not. However, both weak and strong 3D cores yield nearly indistinguishable inner profiles in projection, which implies that ruling out a dark matter cusp from photometric data alone is highly challenging. As an example, we study the profiles of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies and find that they are consistent with both weak and strong 3D cores. This is not just a result of the limited numbers of stars in these systems, since we reach the same conclusion even for Fornax, one of the most luminous and best-studied dwarf spheroidal companions of the Milky Way. We conclude that, based on current data and analysis techniques, cored surface density profiles in nearby dwarf galaxies cannot be taken as strong evidence against the presence of cuspy dark matter halos.

 - **Abstract**
 We present 4MOST-HR resolution Non-Local Thermal Equilibrium (NLTE) Payne artificial neural network (ANN), trained on 404,793 new FGK spectra with 16 elements computed in NLTE. This network will be part of the Stellar Abundances and atmospheric Parameters Pipeline (SAPP), which will analyse 4 million stars during the five year long 4MOST consortium 4: MIlky way Disc And BuLgE High-Resolution (4MIDABLE-HR) survey. A fitting algorithm using this ANN is also presented that is able to fully-automatically and self-consistently derive both stellar parameters and elemental abundances. The ANN is validated by fitting 121 observed spectra of low-mass FGKM type stars, including main-sequence dwarf, subgiant and giant stars down to [Fe/H] $\approx -3.4$ degraded to 4MOST-HR resolution, and comparing the derived abundances with the output of the classical radiative transfer code TSFitPy. We are able to recover all 18 elemental abundances with a bias <0.13 and spread <0.16 dex, although the typical values are <0.09 dex for most elements. These abundances are compared to the OMEGA+ Galactic Chemical Evolution model, showcasing for the first time, the expected performance and results obtained from high-resolution spectra of the quality expected to be obtained with 4MOST. The expected Galactic trends are recovered, and we highlight the potential of using many chemical elements to constrain the formation history of the Galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a joint cosmological analysis of projected galaxy clustering observations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 1 (DESI-DR1), and overlapping weak gravitational lensing observations from three datasets: the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS-1000), the Dark Energy Survey (DES-Y3), and the Hyper-Suprime-Cam Survey (HSC-Y3). This combination of large-scale structure probes allows us to measure a set of $3 \times 2$-pt correlation functions, breaking the degeneracies between parameters in cosmological fits to individual observables. We obtain mutually-consistent constraints on the parameter $S_8 = \sigma_8 \sqrt{\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3} = 0.786^{+0.022}_{-0.019}$ from the combination of DESI-DR1 and DES-Y3, $S_8 = 0.760^{+0.020}_{-0.018}$ from KiDS-1000, and $S_8 = 0.771^{+0.026}_{-0.027}$ from HSC-Y3. These parameter determinations are consistent with fits to the Planck Cosmic Microwave Background dataset, albeit with $1.5-2\sigma$ lower values in the $S_8-\Omega_{\rm m}$ plane. We perform our analysis with a unified pipeline tailored to the requirements of each cosmic shear survey, which self-consistently determines cosmological and astrophysical parameters. We generate an analytical covariance matrix for the correlation data including all cross-covariances between probes, and we design a new blinding procedure to safeguard our analysis against confirmation bias, whilst leaving goodness-of-fit statistics unchanged. Our study is part of a suite of papers that present joint cosmological analyses of DESI-DR1 and weak gravitational lensing datasets.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a joint $3\times2$-pt cosmological analysis of auto- and cross-correlations between the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 1 (DESI-DR1) Bright Galaxy Survey (BGS) and Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) samples and overlapping shear measurements from the KiDS-1000, DES-Y3 and HSC-Y3 weak lensing surveys. We perform our analysis in configuration space and, in addition to the cosmic shear correlation functions for each weak lensing dataset, we fit the tangential shear of the weak lensing source galaxies around DESI lens galaxies. Finally, we make use of the anisotropic BGS and LRG clustering information by fitting the full shape of the two-point correlation function multipoles measured over the full DESI-DR1 footprint, presenting the first full-shape analysis of DESI measurements in configuration space. We find that the addition of weak lensing information serves to improve, with respect to the clustering-only case, the measurements of the power spectrum amplitude parameters $\ln(10^{10}A_{\rm{s}})$ and $\sigma_{12}$ by $15\%$ and $36\%$, respectively. It also improves measurements of the linear bias of the lens galaxies by $15-20\%$, depending on the tracer. Our results show excellent consistency, regardless of the weak lensing survey considered, and are furthermore consistent with a companion analysis that fits $3\times2$-pt correlations including DESI projected clustering measurements, as well as the results published by the weak lensing collaborations themselves. Our measured values for weak lensing amplitude are $S_{8}^{\mathrm{DESI\times HSC}}=0.787\pm0.020$, $S_{8}^{\mathrm{DESI\times DES}}=0.791\pm0.016$, $S_{8}^{\mathrm{DESI\times KiDS}}=0.771\pm0.017$, which are $1.9\sigma-2.9\sigma$ below the $S_8$ value preferred by Planck. Finally, our clustering-only results are in good agreement with the Fourier space full-shape analysis of all DESI tracers.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate redshift estimates are a critical requirement for weak lensing surveys and one of the main uncertainties in constraints on dark energy and large-scale cosmic structure. In this paper, we study the potential to calibrate photometric redshift (photo-z) distributions for gravitational lensing using the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Since beginning its science operations in 2021, DESI has collected more than 50 million redshifts, adding about one million monthly. In addition to its large-scale structure samples, DESI has also acquired over 256k high-quality spectroscopic redshifts (spec-zs) in the COSMOS and XMM and VVDS fields. This is already a factor of 3 larger than previous spec-z calibration compilations in these two regions. Here, we explore calibrating photo-zs for the subset of KiDS-1000 galaxies that fall into joint self-organizing map (SOM) cells overlapping the DESI COSMOS footprint using the DESI COSMOS observations. Estimating the redshift distribution in KiDS-1000 with the new DESI data, we find broad consistency with previously published results while also detecting differences in the mean redshift in some tomographic bins with an average shifts of Delta Mean(z) = -0.028 in the mean and Delta Median(z) = +0.011 in the median across tomographic bins. However, we also find that incompleteness per SOM cell, i.e., groups of galaxies with similar colors and magnitudes, can modify n(z) distributions. Finally, we comment on the fact that larger photometric catalogs, aligned with the DESI COSMOS and DESI XMM and VVDS footprints, would be needed to fully exploit the DESI dataset and would extend the coverage to nearly eight times the area of existing 9-band photometry.

 - **Abstract**
 In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown tremendous promise in solving problems in high energy physics, materials science, and fluid dynamics. In this work, we introduce a new application for GNNs in the physical sciences: instrumentation design. As a case study, we apply GNNs to simulate models of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and show that they are capable of accurately capturing the complex optical physics at play, while achieving runtimes 815 times faster than state of the art simulation packages. We discuss the unique challenges this problem provides for machine learning models. In addition, we provide a dataset of high-fidelity optical physics simulations for three interferometer topologies, which can be used as a benchmarking suite for future work in this direction.

 - **Abstract**
 Matter inside neutron stars is compressed to densities several times greater than nuclear saturation density, while maintaining low temperatures and large asymmetries between neutrons and protons. Neutron stars, therefore, provide a unique laboratory for testing physics in environments that cannot be recreated on Earth. To uncover the highly uncertain nature of cold, ultra-dense matter, discovering and monitoring pulsars is essential, and the SKA will play a crucial role in this endeavour. In this paper, we will present the current state-of-the-art in dense matter physics and dense matter superfluidity, and discuss recent advances in measuring global neutron star properties (masses, moments of inertia, and maximum rotation frequencies) as well as non-global observables (pulsar glitches and free precession). We will specifically highlight how radio observations of isolated neutron stars and those in binaries -- such as those performed with the SKA in the near future -- inform our understanding of ultra-dense physics and address in detail how SKAO's telescopes unprecedented sensitivity, large-scale survey and sub-arraying capabilities will enable novel dense matter constraints. We will also address the potential impact of dark matter and modified gravity models on these constraints and emphasise the role of synergies between the SKA and other facilities, specifically X-ray telescopes and next-generation gravitational wave observatories.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the magnetic field environment around Mars and its response to upstream solar wind conditions provide key insights into the processes driving atmospheric ion escape. To date, global models of Martian induced magnetosphere have been exclusively physics-based, relying on computationally intensive simulations. For the first time, we develop a data-driven model of the Martian induced magnetospheric magnetic field using Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) combined with MAVEN observations and physical laws. Trained under varying solar wind conditions, including B_IMF, P_SW, and {\theta}_cone, the data-driven model accurately reconstructs the three-dimensional magnetic field configuration and its variability in response to upstream solar wind drivers. Based on the PINN results, we identify key dependencies of magnetic field configuration on solar wind parameters, including the hemispheric asymmetries of the draped field line strength in the Mars-Solar-Electric coordinates. These findings demonstrate the capability of PINNs to reconstruct complex magnetic field structures in the Martian induced magnetosphere, thereby offering a promising tool for advancing studies of solar wind-Mars interactions.

 - **Abstract**
 Compact Groups (CGs) of galaxies are dense systems where projected separations are comparable to their optical diameters. A subset - non-isolated CGs - are embedded within major structures. Using multi-band S-PLUS data, we analyse galaxies in 122 non-isolated CGs within more massive systems such as larger groups and clusters. We compare them to galaxies in the host structures, hereafter surrounding group galaxies. Structural parameters were obtained with MorphoPLUS, a pipeline for multi-wavelength Sérsic profile fitting. Dividing galaxies into early (ETG), transition, or late types (LTG), we find: (1) Non-isolated CGs host higher quenched fractions and more ETGs, especially for stellar masses $\log(M/M_\odot) > 10.2$, than surrounding groups. (2) Sérsic indices increase with wavelength for all morphological types in both environments, whereas effective radii show a stronger morphology-dependent behaviour - ETGs become more compact towards redder bands, while LTGs exhibit flatter $Re(\lambda)$ trends. Environmental differences remain weak, with only a modest enhancement of the gradients for ETGs in non-isolated CGs. (3) Transition galaxies in CGs show a concentrated $R_e$-$n$ distribution and faint-end bimodality, consistent with ongoing morphological transformation absent in surrounding groups. (4) Phase-space analysis indicates that some CGs in clusters are projection artefacts, while others are genuine dense systems at various infall stages, from recent arrivals to ancient remnants. These results show that galaxies in non-isolated CGs follow distinct evolutionary paths compared to their surrounding groups galaxies, suggesting that the compact configuration plays a unique role beyond the influence of the larger-scale environment.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational waves (GWs) are unique messengers as they travel through the Universe without alteration except for gravitational lensing. Their long wavelengths make them susceptible to diffraction by cosmic structures, providing an unprecedented opportunity to map dark matter substructures. Identifying lensed events requires the analysis of thousands to millions of simulated events to reach high statistical significances. This is computationally prohibitive with standard GW parameter estimation methods. We build on top of state-of-the-art neural posterior algorithms to accelerate the lensed inference from CPU days to minutes with DINGO-lensing. We showcase its capabilities by reanalyzing GW231123, the most promising lensed candidate so far, and find that its statistical significance cannot exceed 4$\sigma$. We observe that 8% of GW231123-like nonlensed simulations favor lensing, which could be explained by the self-similarity of short-duration signals. Still, 58% of GW231123-like lensed simulations have larger support for lensing, showing that higher detection statistics are possible. Although GW231123 exposes the challenges of claiming the first GW lensing detection, our deep-learning methods have demonstrated to be powerful enough to enable the upcoming discovery of lensed GWs.
