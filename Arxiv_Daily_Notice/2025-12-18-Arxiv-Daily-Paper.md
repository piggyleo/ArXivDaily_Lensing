 - **Abstract**
 The Extragalactic Low Surface Brightness (LSB, $\mu_V\gtrsim 27$ mag/arcsec$^2$) Universe represents a crucial, yet largely unseen, frontier in modern astrophysics. This faint realm holds the keys to completing our understanding of galaxy evolution, hierarchical assembly, and even the fundamental nature of dark matter. Our current theoretical models are inherently incomplete, largely mirroring the properties of the brightest, most easily observed objects. To overcome this critical bias and unlock the secrets of this realm, a transformative leap in observational capability is required. A 30 to 40m class telescope, leveraging unprecedented sensitivity and spatial resolution, especially with adaptive optics, is the essential tool to fundamentally probe these faint, low-density stellar regimes. This white paper details the transformative LSB science that such a facility, strategically positioned in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) to access crucial nearby structures and rich environments, can achieve.

 - **Abstract**
 A 30 m class optical/near-IR telescope in the Northern Hemisphere, equipped for diffraction-limited imaging and high-resolution, multi-object spectroscopy of faint stars, would enable a transformational investigation of the formation and evolution of M31 and its satellite system - on par with what Gaia, the HST, and other major photometric and spectroscopic facilities have achieved for the Milky Way (MW) and its satellites. The unprecedented detail obtained for our home system has reshaped our understanding of the assembly of the MW disk, halo, and bulge, and that of its satellites, which now serve as a benchmark for galaxy formation and evolution models. Extending this level of insight to the M31 system - that of the nearest massive spiral and the only one for which such a comprehensive, resolved stellar population study is feasible - will allow us to address a fundamental question: how representative is the MW and its satellite system within the broader context of galaxy evolution?

 - **Abstract**
 Solar flares are a primary driver of space weather, and forecasting their occurrence remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel flare prediction model based on topologically derived photospheric magnetic parameters. We employ the \texttt{ARTop} framework to compute the time-dependent input rates of magnetic winding and helicity across more than $10^5$ active region (AR) observations, decomposing them into current-carrying and potential components to reduce sensitivity to optical flow methods. An \texttt{XGBoost} machine learning model is trained on these topological time series, alongside engineered features including rolling statistics, kurtosis, and flare history, to predict the probability of $\geq$M1.0-class flares within the next 24 hours. The model demonstrates strong performance on a validation set, with a True Skill Statistic (TSS) of 0.804 for once daily operational region forecasts. When applied to a fully independent holdout set, the operational forecast achieves a TSS of \tsssa. A SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis confirms the model's physical interpretability, identifying flare history and accumulated current-carrying winding and helicity as the most important features. The main challenges identified are false positives arising from ARs with frequent C-class flaring and systematic errors introduced by projection effects when ARs are near the limb. Excluding limb-affected data yields no improvement in the holdout set TSS (\TSSalert\ versus \tsssa), due to the overall decreased number of flares. However, our per-region analysis indicates that mitigating these projection effects is crucial for future operational deployment. This work establishes magnetic topology, particularly its current-carrying components, as a highly effective and physically meaningful set of predictors for solar flare forecasting.

 - **Abstract**
 High-redshift ($z > 3$), massive quiescent galaxies (QGs) offer a significant window into early Universe galaxy formation. Previous works have predicted miscellaneous properties for these quiescents, from an overdensity of neighbors to elevated quenched fractions among such neighbors (i.e. galactic conformity). However, due to a scarcity in highly-resolved deep-field observations until recently, these properties have not been closely examined and pose unresolved questions for galaxy evolution. With new photometric-redshift catalogs from JWST data in the COSMOS-Web field, we present the S$\mathrm{\hat{O}}$NG sample, comprising 171 photometrically selected massive ($\geq10^{10}$ M$_\odot$) QGs with $3\leq$ $z\mathrm{_{phot}}$ $<$ 5. We look for low-mass neighbors around our sample and find substantial populations of star-forming galaxies (SFGs), contrasting the conformity effect at low-$z$. Our QGs also exhibit diverse clustering, from having no neighbors to potentially residing in environments no denser than star-forming equivalents, to being accompanied by SFGs with more stellar mass than the QG itself. Using a geometric method, we also report filamentary signals for 4\% of our sample, suggestive of some QGs' rejuvenation via cold gas accretion. We reapply the analysis on seven spectroscopically confirmed QGs in COSMOS-Web (M$_*$ $\sim$ $10^9-10^{11}$ M$_\odot$) and note similar patterns. Lastly, we report on Saigon, the most distant low-mass quiescent galaxy known to date ($z =$ 4.55, M$_*$ $= 1.33 \times10^9$ M$_\odot$); this spectroscopically confirmed QG resides in a protocluster candidate with 11 SFGs. These results pave new paths towards understanding QG environment, while also signaling an opportune era to examine their evolution with JWST.

 - **Abstract**
 The thermal emission at sub-millimeter wavelengths carries unique information in many astronomical applications ranging from disks and planet formation around young stars, to galaxy evolution studies at cosmological distances. Advancing on the mapping speed to detect this faint emission in ground-based astronomy has been a technical challenge for decades. The APEX Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detector (AMKID) camera was designed to accomplish this task. The instrument is a wide field-of-view camera based on kinetic inductance detectors. It is installed on the 12~meter APEX telescope in Chile at 5.100~meters above see level. The instrument operates dual color, covering simultaneously the 350~GHz and 850~GHz atmospheric windows. It has a large field-of-view of 15.3'x15.3', and an unprecedented number of pixels: 13.952~detectors in the high frequency band and 3.520~detectors in the low frequency band. Here we present a complete description of the instrument design and construction together with results of the successful low frequency array (LFA) commissioning campaign executed during the last year. The LFA performance is in good agreement with design parameters, with detector sensitivity of 2.2~mK$\sqrt{s}$ and diffraction limited beam sizes of 17.0''. On-sky measurements demonstrate a sensitivity of 70-90~mJy$\sqrt{s}$ per detector when operating under good atmospheric conditions (PWV below 1.0mm). With this performance the LFA regularly achieve a mapping sensitivity of 25~mJy when mapping a square degree in an hour. AMKID on APEX with its dual color observing capabilities, high sensitivity, large field-of-view and high angular resolution holds the promise to open a new range of science with the APEX telescope.

 - **Abstract**
 The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is the largest satellite galaxy of the Milky Way and provides a unique laboratory for high-energy astrophysics and dark matter studies. In this work, we develop an end-to-end numerical description of cosmic-ray transport and the associated non-thermal emission in the LMC, extending the public DRAGON and HERMES codes. Within this framework, we compute the diffuse synchrotron radiation produced by cosmic-ray electrons in the LMC and compare our predictions with observed low-frequency radio maps. Because electron diffusion imprints a characteristic morphology on the radio emission, this comparison allows us to infer the effective average diffusion coefficient in the LMC. We find a diffusion coefficient D0 = (3-6) $\times 10^{28} \; \rm{cm}^2 \; \rm{s}^{-1}$ at 1 GeV, comparable to but slightly larger than values typically inferred for the Milky Way. More generally, this work provides a scalable tool for interpreting non-thermal signals in nearby galaxies and constraining their cosmic-ray transport properties.

 - **Abstract**
 The galaxy cluster RXC J0032.1+1808 has been well-studied with optical imaging and gravitational lensing mass maps, both of which reveal an elongated morphology in the north-south direction. We find that its X-ray morphology is bimodal, suggesting that it is in the process of merging; combined with a previously reported detection of a radio relic, we suggest that the system is seen after first pericenter. We extract the global X-ray temperature and unabsorbed luminosity from archival XMM-Newton data, finding $T_X=8.5^{+1.1}_{-0.9}$ keV and $L_X=1.04 \pm 0.03 \times 10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at 90\% confidence in the $0.5$--$10.0$ keV energy range. We conduct a redshift survey of member galaxies and find that the line-of-sight relative velocity between the two subclusters is $76\pm364$ km/s. We use publicly available hydrodynamic simulations to show that it cannot be a head-on merger, that it is observed ${\approx}395$--560 Myr after pericenter, and that the viewing angle must be one that foreshortens the apparent subcluster separation by a factor ${\approx}2$.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper aims to investigate the galaxy-halo connection using a large sample of individual galaxies with $\mathrm{H\,I}$ integrated spectra. We determine their dark matter content by applying a dynamical method based on $\mathrm{H\,I}$ line widths measured with the curve-of-growth technique, together with inclination corrections inferred from optical images. We build a sample of 2453 gas-rich predominantly late-type galaxies spanning a stellar mass range of $10^{8.7}M_\odot$ to $10^{11.4}M_\odot$ by matching them one-to-one with their counterparts from the ALFALFA survey and the TNG100 simulation, ensuring a direct match of stellar mass and $\mathrm{H\,I}$ radius. We generate mock images and mock $\mathrm{H\,I}$ integrated spectra for TNG100 galaxies, and apply the same dynamical method to both ALFALFA and TNG100 mock galaxies to infer their dark matter masses. Across all stellar mass bins, ALFALFA galaxies exhibit lower median dark matter masses than the mock TNG100 simulation results. In each bin, this offset is driven by a tail of galaxies with comparatively low dark matter content, which becomes more prominent toward higher stellar masses. In the highest mass bin ($M_* > 10^{11} M_\odot$), late-type ALFALFA galaxies show a median dark matter mass that is 23% lower than that of their counterparts in the TNG100 dark-matter-only simulation, with 32% of ALFALFA galaxies having $M_\mathrm{DM}(<R_\mathrm{HI})<10^{11.5} M_\odot$, compared to 17% in the mock TNG100 sample. These results suggest that a larger fraction of massive late-type galaxies reside in relatively less massive dark matter haloes than predicted by the TNG100 simulation.

 - **Abstract**
 JWST offers an unprecedented view of optically dark or faint galaxies (OFGs), previously missed by HST. They are likely massive, heavily dust-obscured star-forming galaxies (SFGs) that substantially contribute to the cosmic SFR density at z > 3. To identify drivers of their high dust attenuation and their role in early universe galaxy evolution, we analyse the stellar morphology of 65 OFGs (from 1892 SFGs at 3<z<4) using NIRCAM/F444W imaging from the PRIMER and CEERS fields. We study correlations between dust attenuation ($A_{v}$) and galaxy properties, like stellar mass, size, and orientation, and compare scaling relations between OFGs and typical SFGs. We find that OFGs are ~8-9 times more massive and ~4 times more dust attenuated than the parent sample. Structurally, OFGs resemble parent SFGs in median $R_e$ and median $\Sigma_{R_e}$ but may be slightly rounder on average. While $A_v$ strongly correlates with stellar mass, it does not show significant dependence on stellar mass-normalised effective radius and stellar mass surface density, Sérsic index, axis ratio, or SFR surface density. The mass-size and mass-surface density relations place OFGs as a higher-mass extension of SFGs, with no concrete proof of evolutionary differences between them. This suggests that OFGs are heavily dust-obscured primarily due to their high stellar masses, which facilitates dust production and retention, with older stellar populations likely contributing as well. Although some OFGs exhibit high $\Sigma_\mathrm{R_e}$ and occupy regions of the mass-size plane similar to quiescent galaxies, the overall sample is not representative of this. Their current structures resemble typical SFGs, with no concrete signs of rapid compaction. Diversity in their physical properties shows that OFGs span a range of evolutionary states with few showing reduced star formation, while most remain actively star-forming.
#### Dual-coding contrastive learning based on ConvNeXt and ViT models for morphological classification of galaxies in COSMOS-Web

 - **Abstract**
 In our previous works, we proposed a machine learning framework named \texttt{USmorph} for efficiently classifying galaxy morphology. In this study, we propose a self-supervised method called contrastive learning to upgrade the unsupervised machine learning (UML) part of the \texttt{USmorph} framework, aiming to improve the efficiency of feature extraction in this step. The upgraded UML method primarily consists of the following three aspects. (1) We employ a Convolutional Autoencoder to denoise galaxy images and the Adaptive Polar Coordinate Transformation to enhance the model's rotational invariance. (2) A pre-trained dual-encoder convolutional neural network based on ConvNeXt and ViT is used to encode the image data, while contrastive learning is then applied to reduce the dimension of the features. (3) We adopt a Bagging-based clustering model to cluster galaxies with similar features into distinct groups. By carefully dividing the redshift bins, we apply this model to the rest-frame optical images of galaxies in the COSMOS-Web field within the redshift range of $0.5 < z < 6.0$. Compared to the previous algorithm, the improved UML method successfully classifies 73\% galaxies. Using the GoogleNet algorithm, we classify the morphology of the remaining 27\% galaxies. To validate the reliability of our updated algorithm, we compared our classification results with other galaxy morphological parameters and found a good consistency with galaxy evolution. Benefiting from its higher efficiency, this updated algorithm is well-suited for application in future China Space Station Telescope missions.
#### An updated efficient galaxy morphology classification model based on ConvNeXt encoding with UMAP dimensionality reduction

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15137

 - **Abstract**
 We present an enhanced unsupervised machine learning (UML) module within our previous \texttt{USmorph} classification framework featuring two components: (1) hierarchical feature extraction via a pre-trained ConvNeXt convolutional neural network (CNN) with transfer learning, and (2) nonlinear manifold learning using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for topology-aware dimensionality reduction. This dual-stage design enables efficient knowledge transfer from large-scale visual datasets while preserving morphological pattern geometry through UMAP's neighborhood preservation. We apply the upgraded UML on I-band images of 99,806 COSMOS galaxies at redshift $0.2<z<1.2$ (to ensure rest-frame optical morphology) with $I_{\mathrm{mag}}<25$. The predefined cluster number is optimized to 20 (reduced from 50 in the original framework), achieving significant computational savings. The 20 algorithmically identified clusters are merged into five physical morphology types. About 51\% of galaxies (50,056) were successfully classified. To assess classification effectiveness, we tested morphological parameters for massive galaxies with $M_{*}>10^{9}~M_{\odot}$. Our classification results align well with galaxy evolution theory. This improved algorithm significantly enhances galaxy morphology classification efficiency, making it suitable for large-scale sky surveys such as those planned with the China Space Station Telescope (CSST).
#### Robustness Analysis of USmorph: I. Generalization Efficiency of Unsupervised Strategies and Supervised Learning in Galaxy Morphological Classification

 - **Abstract**
 We conduct a systematic robustness analysis of the hybrid machine learning framework \texttt{USmorph}, which integrates unsupervised and supervised learning for galaxy morphological classification. Although \texttt{USmorph} has already been applied to nearly 100,000 $I$-band galaxy images in the COSMOS field ($0.2 < z < 1.2$, $I_{\mathrm{mag}} < 25$), the stability of its core modules has not been quantitatively assessed. Our tests show that the convolutional autoencoder (CAE) achieves the best performance in preserving structural information when adopting an intermediate network depth, $5\times5$ convolutional kernels, and a 40-dimensional latent representation. The adaptive polar coordinate transform (APCT) effectively enhances rotational invariance and improves the robustness of downstream tasks. In the unsupervised stage, a bagging clustering number of $K=50$ provides the optimal trade-off between classification granularity and labeling efficiency. For supervised learning, we employ GoogLeNet, which exhibits stable performance without overfitting. We validate the reliability of the final classifications through two independent tests: (1) the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) visualization reveals clear clustering boundaries in the low-dimensional space; and (2) the morphological classifications are consistent with theoretical expectations of galaxy evolution, with both true and false positives showing unbiased distributions in the parameter space. These results demonstrate the strong robustness of the \texttt{USmorph} algorithm, providing guidance for its future application to the China Space Station Telescope (CSST) mission.

 - **Abstract**
 Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) predictions of primordial light-element abundances offer a powerful probe of early-Universe physics. However, high-accuracy numerical BBN calculations have become a major computational bottleneck for large-scale cosmological inferences due to the complex nuclear network. Here we present BBNet, a fast and accurate deep learning emulator for primordial abundances. The training data are generated by full numerical calculations using two public BBN codes, PArthENoPE and AlterBBN, modified to accommodate extended cosmologies that include dark radiation and a stiff equation of state. The network employs a residual multi-head architecture to capture convoluted physical relationships. BBNet produces primordial helium-4 and deuterium abundances with negligible errors in milliseconds per sample, achieving a speed-up of up to $10^4$ times relative to first-principles solvers while remaining unbiased over wide parameter ranges. Therefore, our emulator can supersede traditional simplified numerical prescriptions that compromise accuracy for speed. Based on extensive assessments of its performance, we conclude that BBNet is an optimal solution to the theoretical prediction of primordial element abundances. It will serve as a reliable tool for precision cosmology and new-physics searches.

 - **Abstract**
 By the 2040s, several all-sky surveys will have transformed our view of the large-scale structure. However, one of the major outstanding questions in astrophysics will remain: understanding how galaxies acquire and evolve their angular momentum and how this connects to the cosmic web. Measuring the alignments between galaxy spins and cosmic filaments across cosmic time, and understanding what this reveals about galaxy evolution, requires surveys that also characterise intrinsic alignments, i.e. correlations in galaxy shapes produced by the cosmic web itself rather than by lensing. Intrinsic alignments are a major source of systematic error in weak-lensing measurements of the fundamental parameters of the Universe. Addressing both questions together will necessitate new types of MOS surveys that combine kinematic information with high-completeness redshifts down to at least 24-25mag. To achieve our science goals, we require a new generation of wide-field spectroscopic facilities that can obtain spin-filament alignment measurements for millions of galaxies while simultaneously delivering sub-Mpc resolution of the cosmic web and spatially-resolved kinematics required to map the spin-filament connection at the level of individual galaxies within their local cosmic environment. Such a program would provide a unique legacy survey of galaxies and cosmic structures from kiloparsec to megaparsec scales, establishing ESO's leadership in bridging the physics of galaxy evolution with the systematic-control requirements for Stage-IV cosmological surveys.

 Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are major drivers of stellar space weather and can strongly influence the habitability of exoplanets. However, compared to the frequent occurrence of white-light flares, confirmed stellar CMEs remain extremely rare. Whether such flares are commonly accompanied by CMEs is a key question for solar-stellar comparative studies. Using Sun-as-a-star soft X-ray flare light curves observed by the GOES XRS 1--8~Å channel, we compiled a sample of 1,766 M-class and larger solar flares and extracted features with both deep convolutional neural networks and manual methods. Five machine-learning classifiers were trained to distinguish eruptive from confined flares, with the random forest model achieving the best performance (true skill statistic; TSS = 0.31). This TSS value indicates that the model possesses a moderate ability to discriminate between eruptive and confined flares. Normalized white-light and GOES XRS flare light curves show broadly consistent temporal evolution, reflecting their shared energy-release history and supporting a probabilistic transfer of the model to white-light flare data. We applied the best-performing RF model to 41,405 TESS-detected flares on FGKM-type main-sequence stars, predicting that approximately 47% of events show CME-like morphological characteristics, with the model-implied intrinsic association fraction lying in the range 35%--60%. Intriguingly, the CME occurrence rate decreases with increasing flare energy, indicating that the most energetic flares may be more strongly confined by overlying magnetic fields. These results provide new insight into flare-CME connections in diverse stellar environments and have important implications for assessing the impact of stellar eruptive activity on exoplanetary atmospheres.
