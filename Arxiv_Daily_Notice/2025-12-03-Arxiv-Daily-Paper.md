 - **Abstract**
 We analyze the properties of satellite galaxies around 1,024 Milky Way-mass hosts from the DREAMS Project, simulated within a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Utilizing the TNG galaxy-formation model, the DREAMS simulations incorporate both baryonic physics and cosmological uncertainties for a large sample of galaxies with diverse environments and formation histories. We investigate the relative impact of the physical uncertainty from the galaxy-formation model on predicted satellite properties using four metrics: the satellite stellar mass function, radial distribution, inner slope of dark matter density profile, and stellar half-light radius. We compare these predictions to observations from the SAGA Survey and the DREAMS N-body simulations and find that uncertainties from baryonic physics modeling are subdominant to the scatter arising from halo-to-halo variance. Where baryonic modeling does affect satellites, the supernova wind energy has the largest effect on the satellite properties that we investigate. Specifically, increased supernova wind energy suppresses the stellar mass of satellites and results in more extended stellar half-light radii. The adopted wind speed has only a minor impact, and other astrophysical and cosmological parameters show no measurable effect. Our findings highlight the robustness of satellite properties against uncertainties in baryonic physics modeling.

 - **Abstract**
 We present ClumPyLen, a Python-based simulator designed to produce realistic mock observations of strongly lensed, high-redshift, clumpy star-forming galaxies. The tool models galaxy components such as disks, bulges, and spiral arms using Sérsic profiles, and it populates them with stellar clumps whose properties are sampled from physically motivated distributions. ClumPyLen includes the effects of gravitational lensing through user-provided deflection angle maps and simulates realistic observational conditions by accounting for instrumental effects, Point-Spread-Function convolution, sky background, and photon noise. The simulator can support a wide range of filters and instruments; here we focus on HST/ACS, HST/WFC3-IR, and JWST/NIRCam. We demonstrate the capabilities of the code through two examples, including a detailed simulation of the z = 6.145 source Cosmic Archipelago lensed by MACS J0416.1-2403. The simulated images closely match the morphology and limiting magnitudes of real observations. ClumPyLen is designed to explore the detectability of stellar clumps in terms of mass and size, especially in the low-mass regime, and it allows the study of clump blending effects. Thanks to its modular design, the code is highly adaptable to a wide range of scientific goals, including lensing studies, galaxy evolution, and the generation of synthetic datasets for machine learning or forward modeling applications.

 - **Abstract**
 Selection effects, such as interstellar extinction and varying survey depth, complicate efforts to determine the gravitational potential - and thus the distribution of baryonic and dark matter - throughout the Milky Way galaxy using stellar kinematics. We present a new variant of the "Deep Potential" method of determining the gravitational potential from a snapshot of stellar positions and velocities that does not require any modeling of spatial selection functions. Instead of modeling the full six-dimensional phase-space distribution function $f\left(\vec{x},\vec{v}\right)$ of observed kinematic tracers, we model the conditional velocity distribution $p\left(\vec{v}\mid\vec{x}\right)$, which is unaffected by a purely spatial selection function. We simultaneously learn the gravitational potential $\Phi\left(\vec{x}\right)$ and the underlying spatial density of the entire tracer population $n\left(\vec{x}\right)$ - including unobserved stars - using the collisionless Boltzmann equation under the stationarity assumption. The advantage of this method is that unlike the spatial selection function, all of the quantities we model, $p\left(\vec{v}\mid\vec{x}\right)$, $\Phi\left(\vec{x}\right)$, and $n\left(\vec{x}\right)$, typically vary smoothly in both position and velocity. We demonstrate that this "conditional" Deep Potential method is able to accurately recover the gravitational potential in a mock dataset with a complex three-dimensional dust distribution that imprints fine angular structure on the selection function. Because we do not need to model the spatial selection function, our new method can effectively scale to large, complex datasets while using relatively few parameters, and is thus well suited to Gaia data.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on four Local Volume dwarf galaxies identified through our ongoing SEmi-Automated Machine LEarning Search for Semi-resolved galaxies (SEAMLESS): Hydrus A, LEDA 486718, Cetus B, and Sculptor 26, with the discovery of Hydrus A reported here for the first time. These four galaxies span a wide range of environments and evolutionary states. Hydrus A (MV = -9.39+/-0.20, D = 3.38-0.30+0.32 Mpc) and LEDA 486718 (MV = -11.62+/-0.08, D = 4.80+/-0.17 Mpc) are among the most isolated dwarfs known within 5 Mpc, while Cetus B (MV = -8.26+/-0.17, D = 3.32-0.23+0.25 Mpc) and Sculptor 26 (MV = -11.25+/-0.10, D =3.21+/-0.13 Mpc) lie < 2 Rvir of NGC 253. Hydrus A shows properties consistent with quenching driven by cosmic reionization, cosmic-web interactions, or internal feedback. LEDA 486718 is an isolated star forming dwarf. Cetus B appears quenched and morphologically disturbed, making it a low-mass satellite or backsplash candidate, while Sculptor 26 is red and seemingly gas-poor but displays signs of recent activity, consistent with a transitional evolutionary state. Together, these systems demonstrate the power of SEAMLESS for building a census of faint galaxies beyond the Local Group.

 - **Abstract**
 The rapid neutron-capture ($r$-process) element europium (Eu) is a valuable tracer of neutron star mergers and other rare nucleosynthetic events. The stellar spectroscopic survey GALAH's unique wavelength range and setup include the Eu absorption feature at $\sim6645$ Å for almost a million stars in the most recent Data Release 4 (DR4). However, DR4 also saw a decreased precision in reported Eu measurements compared to previous data releases. In this work, we use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to perform label transfer, wherein we use the GALAH DR4 spectra and stellar parameters to infer DR3 [Eu/H] abundances. This CNN is then applied to DR4 spectra without corresponding DR3 Eu abundances to develop a new, publicly available catalogue of [Eu/H] values for high signal-to-noise targets. We include [Eu/H] predictions for $118\,946$ stars, out of which $54\,068$ giants constitute our "golden sample" of high-confidence predictions, which pass stricter quality cuts and have a reported precision $\lesssim0.1$. To overcome the scarcity of training data in the low metallicity regime, we provide an additional catalogue of [Eu/H] abundances for metal poor ($\mathrm{[Fe/H]}<-1$) stars derived from synthesis of the Eu feature. Our "golden sample" can be combined with [Eu/H] values from GALAH DR3 to create a catalogue of over $100\,000$ vetted, high-quality abundances on a homogeneous scale. Moreover, we are able to reproduce known science results, including the elevated Eu abundances of accreted stars and previously observed Galactic chemical evolution trends. This catalogue represents one of the largest available samples of [Eu/H] abundances for high signal-to-noise targets.

 - **Abstract**
 We present results of a spectroscopic campaign around the diffuse dwarf galaxy Crater 2 (Cra2) and its tidal tails as part of the Southern Stellar Stream Spectroscopic Survey ($S^5$). Cra2 is a Milky Way dwarf spheroidal satellite with extremely cold kinematics, but a huge size similar to the Small Magellanic Cloud, which may be difficult to explain within collisionless cold dark matter. We identify 143 Cra2 members, of which 114 belong to the galaxy's main body and 29 are deemed part of its stellar stream. We confirm that Cra2 is dynamically cold (central velocity dispersion $2.51^{+0.33}_{-0.30}\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$) and also discover a $\approx$7$\sigma$ velocity gradient consistent with its tidal debris track. We separately estimate the stream velocity dispersion to be $5.74^{+0.98}_{-0.83}\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$. We develop a suite of $N$-body simulations with both cuspy and cored density profiles on a realistic Cra2 orbit to compare with $S^5$ observations. We find that the velocity dispersion ratio between Cra2 stream and galaxy ($2.30^{+0.41}_{-0.35}$) is difficult to reconcile with a cuspy halo with fiducial concentration and an initial mass predicted by standard stellar mass$-$halo mass relationships. Instead, either a cored halo with relatively small core radius or a low-concentration cuspy model can reproduce this ratio. Despite tidal mass loss, Cra2 is metal-poor ($\langle \rm[Fe/H]\rangle=-2.16\pm0.04$) compared to the stellar mass$-$metallicity relation for its luminosity. Other diffuse dwarf galaxies similar to Cra2 in the Local Group (Antlia 2 and Andromeda 19) also challenge galaxy formation models. Finally, we discuss possible formation scenarios for Cra2, including ram-pressure stripping of a gas-rich progenitor combined with tides.
#### SDSS-V LVM: Resolving Physical Conditions in the Trifid Nebula

 - **Abstract**
 The chemical abundance of the interstellar medium sets the initial conditions for star formation and provides a probe of chemical galaxy evolution models. However, unresolved inhomogeneities in the electron temperature can lead to a systematic underestimation of the abundances. We aim to directly test this effect. We use the SDSS-V Local Volume Mapper to spatially map the physical conditions of the Trifid Nebula (M 20), a Galactic H II region ionized by a single mid-type O star, at 0.24 pc resolution. We exploit various emission lines (e.g., Hydrogen recombination lines and collisionally excited lines, including also faint auroral lines) and compute spatially resolved maps of [O II] and [S II] electron densities; [N II], [O II], [S II], [S III] electron temperatures; and the ionic oxygen abundances. We find internal variations of electron density that result from the ionization front, along with a negative radial gradient. However, we do not find strong gradients or structures in the electron temperature and the total oxygen abundance, making the Trifid Nebula a relatively homogeneous H II region at the observed spatial scale. We compare these spatially resolved properties with equivalent integrated measurements of the Trifid Nebula and find no significant variations between integrated and spatially resolved conditions. This isolated H II region, ionized by a single O-star, represents a test case of an ideal Strömgren sphere. The physical conditions in the Trifid Nebula behave as expected, with no significant differences between integrated and resolved measurements.
#### The suppression of the matter power spectrum: strong feedback from X-ray gas mass fractions, kSZ effect profiles, and galaxy-galaxy lensing

 - **Abstract**
 Baryon feedback redistributes gas relative to the underlying dark matter distribution and suppresses the matter power spectrum on small scales, but the amplitude and scale dependence of this effect are uncertain. We constrain the impact of baryon feedback on the matter power spectrum by jointly analysing X-ray gas mass fractions from the eROSITA and HSC-XXL samples and SDSS/DESI+ACT kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect profiles; the samples are characterised with galaxy-galaxy lensing and together span group and cluster masses at $0<z<1$. Using the baryonification framework, our joint eROSITA and kSZ model gives precise constraints on the suppression of the matter power spectrum: $10 \pm 2\%$ at $k=1~h~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. The inferred gas profiles are more extended and the power suppression is stronger than predicted by the fiducial models of recent hydrodynamical simulation suites, including FLAMINGO and BAHAMAS. The HSC-XXL gas mass fractions, which the fiducial simulations were calibrated to reproduce, prefer more moderate power suppression than the kSZ and eROSITA data: $5 \pm 4\%$ at $k=1~h~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. With a simulated LSST Year 1 weak lensing analysis, we demonstrate a framework for next-generation surveys: calibrating feedback models with multi-wavelength gas observables to recover the small-scale statistical power of cosmic shear.
