#### Revised classification of the CHIME fast radio bursts with machine learning

 - **Abstract**
 Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are short-duration and energetic radio transients of unknown origin. Observationally, they are commonly categorized into repeaters and non-repeaters. However, this binary classification may be influenced by observational limitations such as sensitivity and time coverage of telescopes. In this work, we employ unsupervised machine learning techniques to re-examine the CHIME/FRB catalog, with the goal of identifying intrinsic groupings in the FRB population without relying on preassigned labels. Using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) for dimensionality reduction and hierarchical density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (HDBSCAN) for clustering, we find that the FRB sample separates naturally into two major clusters. One cluster contains nearly all known repeaters but is contaminated by some apparently non-repeaters, while the other cluster is dominated by non-repeaters. This suggests that certain FRBs previously labeled as non-repeaters may share intrinsic similarities with repeaters. The mutual information analysis reveals that rest-frame frequency width and peak frequency are the most informative features governing the clustering structure. Even when reducing the input space to just these two features, the classification remains robust.

 - **Abstract**
 A generic prediction of particle dark matter theories is that a large population of dark matter substructures should reside inside the host haloes of galaxies. In gravitational imaging, strong gravitational lens observations are used to detect individual objects from this population, if they are large enough to perturb the strongly lensed images. We show here that low-mass haloes, below the individually detectable mass limit, have a detectable effect on the lensed images when in large numbers, which is the case in cold dark matter (CDM). We find that, in CDM, this population causes an excess of 40 per cent in the number of detected subhaloes for HST-like strong lens observations. We propose a pseudo-mass function to describe this population, and fit for its parameters from the detection data. We find that it mostly consists of objects two orders of magnitude in mass below the detection limit of individual objects. We show that including this modification, so that the effect of the population is correctly predicted, can dramatically improve the available constraints on dark matter from strong lens observations. We repeat our experiments using models that contain varying amounts of angular structure in the lens galaxy. We find that these multipole perturbations are strongly degenerate with the population signal, to an even greater extent than with individual subhaloes. This further highlights the need for better understanding of the angular mass structure of lens galaxies, so that the maximum information can be extracted from strong lens observations for dark matter inference.
#### Baryonic Ecosystem IN Galaxies (BEINGMgII) -- III. Cool gas reservoirs at $0.3 \le z \le 1.6$ in the Dark Energy Survey

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the origin of intervening cool MgII absorption detected in the spectra of background quasars and the nature of associated galaxies across a broad redshift range of $0.3 \le z \le 1.6$. Using nebular [O II] $\lambda\lambda$3727,3729 emission lines identified in DESI fiber spectra centered on quasar, we detect 377 galaxies at a typical detection rate of $\sim$0.45% at $z \lesssim 1$, which increases with MgII equivalent width ($W_{2796}$). A significant fraction (74%) of these galaxies are associated with strong absorbers with $W_{2796} \ge$ 2Å. These absorbers trace galaxies spanning stellar masses of $\rm 8.4 \le \log(M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) \le 11.6$ and star formation rates (SFRs) of $\rm -1.2 \le log(SFR~[M_{\odot}yr^{-1}]) \le 2.7$, located at projected galactocentric distances of 4-24 kpc. We find the average MgII absorber strength increases from 2.1Å to 2.9Å between redshifts $z \sim$ 0.4 and 1.2, indicating evolution in the cool gas content of galaxy halos. The relatively constant absorber strength with galactocentric distance implies a clumpy structure of cool gas in the circumgalactic medium (CGM). Further, we find a positive correlation between $W_{2796}$ versus $M_\star$, and SFR, suggesting that the distribution of metal-enriched cool gas in the CGM is closely tied to the properties of the host galaxies. The redshift evolution of gas-phase metallicity suggests that strong MgII absorbers trace the general population of star-forming galaxies. The velocity dispersion of the cool gas increases with halo mass, and the wide range of line of sight velocity offset (-389 to 364 $\rm km\ s^{-1}$) between the galaxy systemic velocity and absorbers highlights the dynamical nature of CGM. However, the majority of this gas remains gravitationally bound to the dark matter halos, consistent with a picture of gas recycling via galactic fountains.

 - **Abstract**
 We study an overpopulated gas of gravitationally interacting bosons surrounding a droplet of Bose-Einstein condensate - Bose star. We argue that kinetic evolution of this gas approaches with time a self-similar attractor solution to the kinetic equation. If the scale symmetry of the equation is broken by external conditions, the attractor solution exists, remains approximately self-similar, but has slowly drifting scaling dimension. The latter new regime of adiabatic self-similarity can determine growth of dark matter Bose stars in cosmological models.

 - **Abstract**
 Some massive, quiescent galaxies at z>3 appear to contain considerable numbers of old stars (forming at z>7). Works inferring the star formation histories of at least one such galaxy observed with JWST have suggested that the assembly of so much stellar mass so early may challenge the well-established Cold Dark Matter (CDM) cosmological framework, or else indicate extraordinarily high past star formation efficiencies. However, these studies implicitly assume that all the stars in place at the epoch of observation assembled in-situ, i.e. in a single galaxy. In hierarchical models like CDM, massive galaxies assemble following successive mergers of smaller galaxies. Thus, inferences of the growth of stellar mass using the ages of stars within a descendant massive galaxy will be biased. In this paper, I use the TNG100 simulation to quantify this bias across a range of descendant galaxy masses and redshifts, for inferences made for different past epochs. I demonstrate that the assumption of in-situ stellar mass assembly can lead to significant biases in inferred stellar mass histories, with historic (i.e. looking back from the epoch of observation) stellar masses overestimated by over an order of magnitude in some cases. The bias increases with increasing halo mass, for inferences made further from the epoch of observation, and with decreasing descendant galaxy redshift. I derive corrections that can be applied to inferred stellar mass histories for more robust comparisons with dark matter halo mass functions at high redshift.
#### Updated bounds on ultra-light dark matter from the tiniest galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 The particle mass of dark matter (DM) was previously constrained using kinematics of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies to $m > 3 \times 10^{-19}\,\mathrm{eV}$. This constraint, which excludes the "fuzzy" range of ultra-light dark matter from comprising all of the DM, relies on an estimate of the heating rate from fuzzy dark matter (FDM) wave interference using linear perturbation theory. Here, we compare the results of this perturbative calculation to full Schrödinger-Poisson simulations of the evolution of star particles in FDM halos. This comparison confirms theoretical expectations that FDM heating is stronger in fully nonlinear simulations due to the formation of a dense central soliton whose fluctuations enhance gravitational perturbations, and that bounds on the DM particle mass using this perturbative method are indeed conservative. We also show that these bounds are not affected by possible tidal stripping, since for dwarf satellites like Segue 1, the tidal radius is much larger than the observed size of the galaxy. We further show that the constraints on the mass cannot be evaded by invoking DM self-interactions, due to constraints on the self-interaction from large-scale structure. Lastly, we show that if the recently discovered system Ursa Major III/UNIONS I is a galaxy, the observed properties of this object strengthen the lower bound on the DM mass by over an order of magnitude, to $m > 8 \times 10^{-18}\,\mathrm{eV}$, at 95% confidence. This constraint could further be strengthened considerably by more precise measurements of the size and velocity dispersion of this and other similar galaxies, and by using full Schrödinger-Poisson simulations.

 [abridged] Accurately accounting for the AGN phase in galaxy evolution requires a large, clean AGN sample. This is now possible with SRG/eROSITA. The public Data Release 1 (DR1, Jan 31, 2024) includes 930,203 sources from the Western Galactic Hemisphere. The data enable the selection of a large AGN sample and the discovery of rare sources. However, scientific return depends on accurate characterisation of the X-ray emitters, requiring high-quality multiwavelength data. This paper presents the identification and classification of optical and infrared counterparts to eRASS1 sources using Gaia DR3, CatWISE2020, and Legacy Survey DR10 (LS10) with the Bayesian NWAY algorithm and trained priors. Sources were classified as Galactic or extragalactic via a Machine Learning model combining optical/IR and X-ray properties, trained on a reference sample. For extragalactic LS10 sources, photometric redshifts were computed using Circlez. Within the LS10 footprint, all 656,614 eROSITA/DR1 sources have at least one possible optical counterpart; about 570,000 are extragalactic and likely AGN. Half are new detections compared to AllWISE, Gaia, and Quaia AGN catalogues. Gaia and CatWISE2020 counterparts are less reliable, due to the surveys shallowness and the limited amount of features available to assess the probability of being an X-ray emitter. In the Galactic Plane, where the overdensity of stellar sources also increases the chance of associations, using conservative reliability cuts, we identify approximately 18,000 Gaia and 55,000 CatWISE2020 extragalactic sources. We release three high-quality counterpart catalogues, plus the training and validation sets, as a benchmark for the field. These datasets have many applications, but in particular empower researchers to build AGN samples tailored for completeness and purity, accelerating the hunt for the Universe most energetic engines.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent studies suggest that dark energy may be dynamical rather than being a mere cosmological constant $\Lambda$. In this work, we examine the viability of two physically well-motivated dynamical dark energy models -- holographic dark energy (HDE) and Ricci dark energy (RDE) -- by confronting them with the latest observational data, including ACT cosmic microwave background anisotropies, DESI baryon acoustic oscillations, and DESY5 supernovae. Our analysis reveals a fundamental tension between early- and late-universe constraints within both frameworks: ACT favors a quintom scenario where the dark energy equation of state (EoS) evolves from $w>-1$ at early times to $w<-1$ at late times, while DESI+DESY5 exhibits a distinct preference for quintessence where $w>-1$ across cosmic evolution. The joint analysis yields constraints that align more closely with the ACT preference. Critically, the canonical RDE model fails to provide a coherent description of cosmic evolution, as it manifests severe tensions (even exceeding $10\sigma$ significance) between early- and late-universe parameter reconstructions. Based on the combined data, Bayesian evidence decisively disfavors both HDE and RDE models relative to the $\Lambda$ cold dark matter model, with ACT providing decisive disfavor and DESI+DESY5 yielding moderate disfavor. Our results show that the HDE and RDE models remain excluded by the new data, reinforcing earlier conclusions drawn from previous datasets.
#### Machine Learning Classification of COSMOS2020 Galaxies: Quiescent vs. Star-Forming

 - **Abstract**
 Accurately distinguishing between quiescent and star-forming galaxies is essential for understanding galaxy evolution. Traditional methods, such as spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, can be computationally expensive and may struggle to capture complex galaxy properties. This study aims to develop a robust and efficient machine learning (ML) classification method to identify quiescent and star-forming galaxies within the Farmer COSMOS2020 catalog. We utilized JWST wide-field light cones from the Santa Cruz semi-analytical modeling framework to train a supervised ML model, the CatBoostClassifier, using 28 color features derived from 8 mutual photometric bands within the COSMOS catalog. The model was validated against a testing set and compared to the SED-fitting method in terms of precision, recall, F1-score, and execution time. Preprocessing steps included addressing missing data, injecting observational noise, and applying a magnitude cut (ch1 < 26 AB) along with a redshift range of 0.2 < z < 3.5 to align the simulated and observational datasets. The ML method achieved an F1-score of 89\% for quiescent galaxies, significantly outperforming the SED-fitting method, which achieved 54%. The ML model demonstrated superior recall (88% vs. 38%) while maintaining comparable precision. When applied to the COSMOS2020 catalog, the ML model predicted a systematically higher fraction of quiescent galaxies across all redshift bins within 0.2 < z < 3.5 compared to traditional methods like NUVrJ and SED-fitting. This study shows that ML, combined with multi-wavelength data, can effectively identify quiescent and star-forming galaxies, providing valuable insights into galaxy evolution. The trained classifier and full classification catalog are publicly available.

 - **Abstract**
 Thermal and magneto-thermal simulations are an important tool for advancing understanding of neutron stars, as they allow us to compare models of their internal structure and physical processes against observations constraining macroscopic properties such as the surface temperature. A major challenge in the simulations is in modelling of the outermost layers, known as the envelope, exhibiting a drop of many orders of magnitude in temperature and density in a geometrically thin shell. This is often addressed by constructing a separate envelope model in plane-parallel approximation that produces a relation between the temperature at the bottom of the envelope, $T_b$, and the surface temperature, $T_s$. Our aim is to construct a general framework for approximating the $T_b$-$T_s$ relation that is able to include the dependencies from the strength and orientation of the magnetic field. We used standard prescriptions to calculate a large number of magnetised envelope models to be used as a training sample and employed single-hidden-layer feedforward neural networks as approximators, providing the flexibility, high accuracy, and fast evaluation necessary in neutron star simulations. We explored the optimal network architecture and hyperparameter choices and used a special holdout set designed to avoid overfitting to the structure of the input data. We find that relatively simple neural networks are sufficient for the approximation of the $T_b$-$T_s$ relation with an accuracy $\sim 3\%$. The presented workflow can be used in a wide range of problems where simulations are used to construct approximating formulae.

 - **Abstract**
 \textit{What is the cosmological information content of a cubic Gigaparsec of dark matter? } Extracting cosmological information from the non-linear matter distribution has high potential to tighten parameter constraints in the era of next-generation surveys such as Euclid, DESI, and the Vera Rubin Observatory. Traditional approaches relying on summary statistics like the power spectrum and bispectrum, though analytically tractable, fail to capture the full non-Gaussian and non-linear structure of the density field. Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) provides a powerful alternative by learning directly from forward-modeled simulations. In this work, we apply SBI to the \textit{Quijote} dark matter simulations and introduce a hierarchical method that integrates small-scale information from field sub-volumes or \textit{patches} with large-scale statistics such as power spectrum and bispectrum. This hybrid strategy is efficient both computationally and in terms of the amount of training data required. It overcomes the memory limitations associated with full-field training. We show that our approach enhances Fisher information relative to analytical summaries and matches that of a very different approach (wavelet-based statistics), providing evidence that we are estimating the full information content of the dark matter density field at the resolution of $\sim 7.8~\mathrm{Mpc}/h$.
#### The slow evolution of dark matter halos from cusp to core naturally produces extended stellar core-like distributions

 - **Abstract**
 Motivated by the observation of extended stellar cores in dark matter (DM) dominated dwarf galaxies, this study investigates a simple mechanism by which stellar cores can form as a result of DM halo expansion. Several non-CDM models predict that the DM distribution thermalizes over time, transforming initially cuspy halos into cores. This transformation weakens the gravitational potential, allowing the stellar component to expand and form diffuse, core-like structures. Using analytical models and adiabatic invariants, we examine stellar systems with purely tangential, purely radial, and isotropic orbits evolving under a slowly changing potential. Across a wide range of initial and final conditions, we find that stellar cores form relatively easily, though their properties depend sensitively on these conditions. Orbit types preserve their nature during the DM halo expansion: tangential and radial orbits remain so, while isotropic orbits remain nearly isotropic in the central regions. Systems with circular orbits develop stellar cores when the initial stellar density logarithmic slope lies between -0.5 and -1.2, whereas radial systems do not form cores. Isotropic systems behave similarly to tangential ones, producing cores that are isotropic in the center but develop increasing radial anisotropy outward; the anisotropy parameter "beta" grows from sim 0.07 at the core radius to sim 0.5 at three core radii. The theoretical and observational literature suggests initial DM profiles with steep slopes and stellar distributions that are shallower and isotropic at the center. Given these conditions, the mechanism predicts stellar cores with radii at least 40 % that of the DM core and inner logarithmic slopes shallower than 0.6.
#### Tidally induced bar-like galaxies in simulated clusters

 - **Abstract**
 One of the scenarios for bar formation in galaxies involves their interaction with a more massive companion. The stellar component is then transformed from a disk into a bar-like prolate spheroid. I investigated a subsample of 77 bar-like galaxies tidally induced in the cluster environment, selected among the previously studied sample of bar-like galaxies from the IllustrisTNG simulations. I present six clear, convincing examples of bar-like galaxies formed after an interaction with a progenitor of a massive brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) and describe the properties of their bars. For the whole sample, the time of bar formation is strongly correlated with and typically slightly greater than the time of the pericenter passage. All galaxies are strongly stripped of dark matter and gas, and their rotation is similarly diminished. A larger pericenter distance typically requires a higher host mass in order to transform the galaxy, but the interactions show no preference for prograde configurations. The final strength of the bars does not correlate with the amount of tidal stripping experienced because of the variety of initial properties of the progenitors and the subsequent evolution over the next pericenter passages. In spite of difficulties in the interpretation of some cases involving mergers and multiple interactions, the results confirm in the cosmological context the reality of tidal bar formation in cluster environments previously studied using controlled simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 The accretion of dark matter (DM) onto compact objects and the potential gravitational collapse of neutron stars due to this accretion has become a promising indirect probe of DM properties, complementing terrestrial experiments. We show that the accretion flux of DM on stellar objects is amplified in binary systems due to the complex gravitational interaction of said particles with the binary. We perform few-body Monte Carlo simulations to show that this amplification factor is $\sim4-5$ for circular binaries, small DM velocity dispersions and mass ratios $q\gtrsim0.3$. We use this factor to improve previous constraints on the scattering cross section of non-annihilating bosonic DM with baryonic matter, and derive upper bounds on this cross section from the observation of the binary NS merger associated with GW170817. We also show that the maximally accretable mass fraction of DM by binary NSs is $\lesssim10^{-3}$, even for extreme DM densities only possible in DM spikes, due to the dynamical friction exerted by the ambient DM.
#### A two-phase model of galaxy formation: IV. Seeding and growing supermassive black holes in dark matter halos

 - **Abstract**
 We present a theoretical framework for seeding and growing supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in dark-matter halos along their assembly histories. Seeds are bred out of Pop-III stars formed during the first collapse of pristine gas in mini-halos that have reached the ${\rm H}_2$-cooling limit, modulated by UV radiation from star formation and dynamical heating from fast halo assembly. Such breeding persists until the enrichment of the intergalactic medium (IGM) enables Pop-II stars to form. Post-seeding growth of black holes (BHs) is driven by distinct channels, starting with episodic super-Eddington accretion associated with nuclear bursts induced by global disturbances of galaxies, followed by sustained sub-Eddington accretion via capturing sub-clouds formed in self-gravitating gas clouds (SGCs) in halos of fast assembly, and ending with merger-dominated, quiescent growth. We implement the model in subhalo merger trees to build a coherent framework to follow the SMBH-galaxy-halo co-evolution over their full lives in the full structure hierarchy. BH seeds are bred with a broad mass spectrum of $M_{\rm BH} = 10$--$10^5\,{\rm M}_\odot$ at $z \approx 20$--$30$ in mini-halos with masses of $10^5$--$10^8\,{\rm M}_\odot$. Nuclear bursts provide the key condition for seeds to grow into SMBHs. The $M_{\rm BH}$-$M_*$ relation is a multi-piece, redshift-dependent function shaped by the interplay among different growth channels. Our model predictions are broadly consistent with existing observations; especially, a population of BHs reminiscent of `little red dots' (LRDs) discovered by JWST naturally results from the seeding and growing processes. Potential future tests of the model are discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 The High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Observatory comprises 300 water Cherenkov detectors, each equipped with four photomultipliers, located on the Volcán Sierra Negra in Mexico at 4,100 masl. This observatory can detect gamma rays in an energy range from 300 GeV to 100 TeV and cosmic rays from 100 GeV to 1 PeV. One of HAWC's primary challenges is characterizing air showers and estimate their physical parameters, a highly complex task due to the nature of the data and the processes involved. Currently, HAWC employs two energy estimators for gamma rays: the ground parameter method and a neural network-based approach. However, for cosmic rays, only the likelihood-based estimator is available. In this work, we leverage machine learning techniques to achieve more accurate estimation of the physical parameters of cosmic rays. These techniques are explored as an alternative for reconstructing the physical properties of extensive air showers using simulated data aligned with the observatory's configuration. Various models were trained and evaluated through an optimized pipeline and the most effective one was selected as the final implementation after a comprehensive comparison. This approach improves the accuracy of physical parameter estimation, contributing significantly to the detailed characterization of cosmic ray events.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: While the LMC's influence on MW stellar streams has been extensively studied, streams associated with the Clouds have received far less attention. Beyond the Magellanic Stream, only four stream candidates (S1-S4) have been reported. Aims: We focus on the S3 stream, a long ($\sim30^\circ$) and narrow ($\sim1.2^\circ$) structure at 60-80 kpc, nearly aligned with the LMC. Our goals are: 1) to validate the stream through a kinematic analysis of S3 candidates with Gaia DR3 data; 2) to enlarge the sample of potential members; and 3) to model the stream in order to test its association with either the MW or the LMC. Methods: We selected new S3 candidates with a neural network classifier trained on Gaia DR3 data, and further reduced contamination through a cut in the proper-motion space. To investigate the origin of S3, we evolve stream models within time-dependent, deforming MW and LMC haloes, thereby accounting for possible effects of the MW-LMC interaction. Results: We identify 1,542 high-confidence new S3 stream candidates and find that the stream's apparent width has grown from $\sim1.2^\circ$ to $\sim3$-$4^\circ$ compared to previous studies. We also present a list of 440 potential S3 red clump stars, which are valuable targets for spectroscopic follow-up thanks to their well-defined luminosities and ability to yield precise distances. Both modelling and a comparison of S3 stars' closest approach distance and velocity with the LMC's escape velocity indicate that S3 is unlikely to originate from the LMC, instead representing a distant ($\sim75$ kpc) MW stream. Conclusions: S3 is the most distant ($\sim75$ kpc) extended ($\sim30^\circ$ long, $\sim3$-$4^\circ$ thick) MW stream known, offering a unique probe of the outer halo and the LMC's recent influence. Its angular width corresponds to a physical thickness of $\sim4$-5 kpc, making S3 among the thickest streams discovered.
