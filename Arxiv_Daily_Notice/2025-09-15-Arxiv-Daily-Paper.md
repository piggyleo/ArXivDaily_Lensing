 - **Abstract**
 IceAct is an array of imaging air Cherenkov telescopes located at the ice surface above the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. Each telescope features a silicon photomultiplier based 61 pixel camera and a Fresnel-lens as imaging optic, resulting in a 12-degree field of view. The design is optimized to be operated in harsh environments, particularly at the South Pole. The setup will consist of seven telescopes in a so-called fly's eye configuration, increasing the field of view to 36^\circ, and an additional telescope 200m apart for stereoscopic observations. Rigorous testing procedures have been performed before deployment to ensure that operation under these conditions is possible, e.g. night sky observations and cold temperature tests. Furthermore, on-site calibrations are used to verify the accuracy and reliability of the installation. We derive the geometric alignment of each IceAct telescope by comparing the directional reconstruction of muons measured with IceCube to the corresponding primary particle direction reconstruction from IceAct. This contribution presents these testing procedures. Additionally, we present the on-site alignment calibration, including a Graph Neural Network reconstruction for the primary particle direction in IceAct, verification on Monte Carlo simulation, and the application to a commissioning dataset.

 - **Abstract**
 As the Vera Rubin Observatory begins its ten-year survey in 2025, it will probe key observables such as strong lensing (SL) by galaxies and clusters. In preparation for this new era, we assemble an extensive compilation of SL candidate systems from the literature, comprising over 30,000 unique objects that can be used as a watch list of known systems. By cross-matching this sample with photometric and spectroscopic catalogs, we construct two value-added tables containing key parameters for SL analysis, including lens and source redshifts and lens velocity dispersions $\sigma_v$. As a preparation for Rubin, we generate image cutouts for these systems in existing wide-field surveys with subarcsecond seeing, namely CFHTLens, CS82, RCSLens, KiDS, HSC, DES, and DESI Legacy. This sample, dubbed the "Last Stand Before Rubin" (LaStBeRu), has a myriad of applications, from using archival data to selections for follow-up projects and training of machine learning algorithms. As an application, we perform a test of General Relativity using these data, combining the effects of motion of massless particles (through SL modeling) and non-relativistic bodies through $\sigma_v$, which allow one to set constraints on the Post-Newtonian parameter $\gamma_\mathrm{PPN}$. Using the LaStBeRu database, we present an independent test of $\gamma_\mathrm{PPN}$ (distinct from previous analyses) and, for the first time, we present such a test exclusively with systems identifiable in ground-based images. By combining these data with the previously published samples, we obtain the most stringent constraint on $\gamma_\mathrm{PPN}$. Our results are consistent with GR at the $\sim$~1-$\sigma$ level and with the previous results from the literature.
#### The Hubble constant from the improved lens modeling of cluster-lensed supernova Refsdal with new spectroscopic redshifts and the Jackknife method
 - **Authors:** Yuting Liu, Masamune Oguri

 - **Abstract**
 Time-delay cosmology offers an alternative approach to measuring the Hubble constant ($H_0$), which is distinct from the cosmic distance ladder and cosmic microwave background radiation methods. In this study, we present an improved strong lens mass modeling analysis of the cluster-lensed supernova Refsdal, incorporating the latest spectroscopic redshift data from the MUSE on the Very Large Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope CANUCS/Technicolor. The robustness of our lens models is confirmed using the Jackknife method. From our analysis that considers four lens mass models with different assumptions on profiles of dark matter halos and external perturbations, we derive a constraint on the Hubble constant of $H_0=66.0\pm{4.3}\Mpc$ after combining best-fitted values of the four lens models.
#### Signatures of dynamical activity in the hot gas profiles of groups and clusters in the FLAMINGO simulations

 - **Abstract**
 In anticipation of upcoming cosmological surveys, we use the large volume Flamingo hydrodynamical simulations to look for signatures of dynamical activity, focusing on the hot gas profiles of groups and clusters out to redshift $z=1$. To determine the dynamical state of each object, we consider the halo mass accretion rate, $\Gamma$, as well as three observational proxies: stellar mass gap, $\Mstar$; X-ray concentration, $c_\mathrm{x}$, and X-ray centroid shift, $\left<w\right>$. In general, the median values of these indicators vary in accordance with an increase in dynamical activity with both mass and redshift. We find $\left<w\right>$ to be the most reliable proxy, while $c_\mathrm{x}$ and $\Mstar$ are more sensitive to resolution and feedback model details. Looking at the profiles, the correlation between dark matter density and $\Gamma$ has a characteristic radial dependence, being negatively (positively) correlated at small (large) radii. This trend is insensitive to both halo mass and redshift. Similar behaviour is also seen for the hot gas densities in low redshift clusters, particularly when using $\left<w\right>$, but the correlations become weaker in groups, at higher redshift and when stronger feedback is employed. We also find the intrinsic scatter in the gas density profiles to decrease with redshift, particularly in groups, contrary to what is seen for the dark matter. Interestingly, the radius of minimum gas density scatter increases with feedback strength, suggesting that this property could be a useful feedback diagnostic in future observational studies.
#### Joint X-ray, kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich, and weak lensing measurements: toward a consensus picture of efficient gas expulsion from groups and clusters

 - **Abstract**
 There is no consensus on how baryon feedback shapes the underlying matter distribution from either simulations or observations. We confront the uncertain landscape by jointly analyzing new measurements of the gas distribution around groups and clusters -- DESI+ACT kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect profiles and eROSITA X-ray gas masses -- with mean halo masses characterized by galaxy-galaxy lensing. Across a wide range of halo masses ($M_{500}=10^{13-14}M_\odot$) and redshifts ($0<z<1$), we find evidence of more efficient gas expulsion beyond several $R_{500}$ than predicted by most state-of-the-art simulations. A like-with-like comparison reveals all kSZ and X-ray observations are inconsistent with the fiducial 1 Gpc$^{3}$ hydrodynamical FLAMINGO simulation, which was calibrated to reproduce pre-eROSITA X-ray gas fractions: eROSITA X-ray gas fractions are $2\times$ lower than the simulation, and the kSZ measurements are combined $>8 \sigma$ discrepant. The FLAMINGO simulation variant with the most gas expulsion, and therefore the most suppression of the matter power spectrum relative to a dark matter only simulation, provides a good description of how much gas is expelled and how far it extends; the enhanced gas depletion is achieved by more powerful but less frequent AGN outbursts. Joint kSZ, X-ray, and lensing measurements form a consistent picture of gas expulsion beyond several $R_{500}$, implying a more suppressed matter power spectrum than predicted by most recent simulations. Complementary observables and next-generation simulations are critical to understanding the physical mechanism behind this extreme gas expulsion and mapping its impact on the large-scale matter distribution.
