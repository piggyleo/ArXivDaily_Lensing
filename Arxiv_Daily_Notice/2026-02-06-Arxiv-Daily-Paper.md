 - **Abstract**
 In both observed and simulated galaxies, disk morphologies become more prevalent at higher masses and lower redshifts. To elucidate the physical origin of this trend, we develop a simple analytical model in which galaxy morphology is governed by the competition between rotational support and turbulence in a gravitational potential of a dark matter halo and the galaxy itself, and a disk forms when the potential steepens due to the accumulation of baryons in the halo center. The minimum galaxy mass required for this transition decreases with an increasing dark matter contribution within the galaxy, making more concentrated halos more prone to forming disks. Our model predicts that galaxy sizes behave qualitatively differently before and after disk formation: after disks form, sizes are governed by the halo spin, in agreement with classical models, whereas before disk formation, sizes are larger and set by the scale on which turbulent motions, which dominate over rotation, can be contained. We validate our model against the results of the TNG50 cosmological simulation and, despite the simplicity of the model, find remarkable agreement. In particular, our model explains the increase with redshift in the critical halo mass for disk formation, reported in both simulations and observations, as a consequence of the evolution of the halo mass-concentration and baryonic mass-halo mass relations. This redshift trend therefore supports the recent proposal that it is the steepening of the gravitational potential that causes disk formation, while other effects discussed in the literature, such as potential deepening and hot gaseous halo formation, can still play important roles in the transition from early turbulent to dynamically cold disks.

 - **Abstract**
 The distribution of dark matter in the inner regions of galaxies poses a key challenge for small-scale {\Lambda}CDM cosmology. While cold dark matter simulations predict cuspy inner density profiles, observations of low surface brightness (LSB) and dwarf galaxies often favour cored profiles, an issue known as the cusp-core problem. We investigate this problem by comparing four dark matter halo profiles: NFW (cuspy), Einasto (intermediate), Burkert (cored), and pseudo-isothermal (pISO) (cored) in a pilot sample of $11$ galaxies from the GMRT archive atomic gas survey (GARCIA). We have performed mass modelling using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques, utilising rotation curves derived from robust 3D Kinematic modelling. Baryonic contributions from stars derived using stellar kinematics based on $3.6\mu\mathrm{m}$ or $r$-band photometry via Multi-Gaussian Expansion (MGE) combined with Jeans Anisotropic Model (JAM) and from gas, calculated directly from the gas surface density (HI + He) without assuming any predefined functional form, are included. Our mass modelling shows that all halo profiles provide statistically good fits, yielding consistent estimates of halo mass and stellar mass-to-light ratio. To validate our analysis, we examine the stellar-to-halo mass relation and find broad agreement with empirical models. Non-parametric density profiles derived from baryon-subtracted rotation curves show that NFW fits the inner regions best, while all profiles converge in the outskirts. Future studies with a larger sample from GARCIA will be helpful in refining this trend and addressing the cusp-core issue in greater depth.
#### Wiggling Through the ICM: Multi-Resolution Radio Imaging of a Tailed Radio Galaxy in MACS J1354.6+7715

 - **Abstract**
 Tailed radio galaxies are powerful tracers of interactions between active galactic nuclei (AGN) and the intracluster medium (ICM), providing unique insights into cluster dynamics. We present LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) 144 MHz and uGMRT 400 MHz observations of the cluster MACS J1354.6+7715 (z = 0.3967) to investigate the radio emission associated with its member galaxies and the cluster environment. The dominant tailed radio galaxy in the cluster exhibits a sharply bent tail extending over approximately 300 kpc, with the spectral index steepening from approximately -0.46 +/- 0.21 near the AGN core to approximately -2.43 +/- 0.30 in the outermost regions. Synchrotron modelling of the tail yields a radiative age of 150 +/- 10 Myr, implying a galaxy velocity of 1956 +/- 130 km s^-1, which is of order ~ 0.9 times the escape velocity. We find no evidence of relics or halos in our radio images, and the X-ray morphology from Chandra appears relatively undisturbed, suggesting that the system is a pre-merging candidate. Our results indicate that the radio galaxy is undergoing its first infall into the cluster, providing an excellent laboratory for studying the impact of the ICM on AGN activity and galaxy evolution, and demonstrating how multi-frequency radio observations of tailed galaxies can uniquely probe both AGN lifecycles and the early stages of cluster assembly.

 - **Abstract**
 With tens to hundreds of spectra of white dwarfs being taken each night from multi-object spectroscopic surveys, automated spectral classification is essential as part of efficient data processing. In this study, we design a neural network to classify the spectral type of white dwarfs using a combination of spectra from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) data release~1 and imaging from Pan-STARRS photometry. The trained network has a near 100% accuracy at identifying DA and DB white dwarf spectral types, while having an 85-95% accuracy for identifying all other primary types, including metal pollution. Distinct spectral or photometric features map into separate structures when performing a Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) dimensionality reduction. Investigating further and looking at multiple epoch spectra, we performed a separate search for objects that have strongly changing spectral signatures using UMAP, discovering 3 new inhomogeneous surface composition ('double-faced') white dwarfs in the process. We lastly show how machine learning has the potential to separate single white dwarfs from double white dwarf binary star systems in a large dataset, ideal for isolating a single star population. The results from all of these techniques show a compelling use of machine learning to boost efficiency in analysing white dwarfs observed in multi-object spectroscopy surveys, at times replacing the need for human-driven spectral classifications. This demonstrates our techniques as powerful tools for batch population analyses, finding outliers as a form of rare subclass detection, and in conducting multi-epoch spectral analyses.
#### Differentiable Stochastic Halo Occupation Distribution with Galaxy Intrinsic Alignments

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04977

 - **Abstract**
 We present diffHOD-IA, a fully differentiable implementation of a halo occupation distribution (HOD) model that incorporates galaxy intrinsic alignments (IA). Motivated by the diffHOD framework, we create a new implementation that extends differentiable galaxy population modeling to include orientation-dependent statistics crucial for weak gravitational lensing analyses. Our implementation combines this HOD formulation with an IA model, enabling end-to-end automatic differentiation from HOD and IA parameters through to the galaxy field. We additionally extend this framework to differentiably model two-point correlation functions, including galaxy clustering and IA statistics. We validate diffHOD-IA against the reference halotools-IA implementation using the Bolshoi-Planck simulation, demonstrating excellent agreement across both one-point and two-point statistics. We verify the accuracy of gradients computed via automatic differentiation by comparison with finite-difference estimates for both HOD and IA parameters. We present science use cases leveraging gradients in the simulations to recover the IA parameters of a galaxy field representative of the TNG300 simulation. Finally, we apply diffHOD-IA in a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo analysis and compare its performance with halotools-IA and a neural-network-based emulator, IAEmu. Unlike emulator-based approaches, diffHOD-IA provides differentiability at the catalog level, enabling integration into field-level inference pipelines and extension to arbitrary summary statistics for next-generation weak-lensing analyses. Our code is publicly available.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a systematic study of the environments of 25 luminous quasars at $z > 6.5$ from the ASPIRE program. Using JWST/NIRCam WFSS data, we identified 487 galaxies at $5.3 \lesssim z \lesssim 7.0$ exhibiting [OIII] emission. Among these, 122 [OIII] emitters lie within $|\Delta v_{\rm los}| < 1000~{\rm km~s^{-1}}$ of the quasars, corresponding to a $\sim9.4$-fold enhancement relative to the average galaxy density at other redshifts. Furthermore, we identified 16 [CII]-emitting galaxies at the quasar redshifts from ALMA mosaic observations. A cross-correlation function (CCF) analysis between quasars and [OIII]+[CII] emitters yields a cross-correlation length of $r_0^{\rm QG} = 8.68^{+0.51}_{-0.55}~h^{-1}~\mathrm{cMpc}$ and a auto-correlation of $r_0^{\rm{QQ}}=15.76^{+2.48}_{-2.70}~h^{-1}~{\rm cMpc}$, indicating that $z \sim 7$ quasars reside in dark matter halos with $M_{\rm halo} = 10^{12.27^{+0.21}_{-0.26}}~M_\odot$. Notably, the number of [OIII]-emitting galaxies at quasar redshifts varies significantly from field to field, ranging from zero to twenty, highlighting a diverse quasar environment. Remarkably, seven quasars trace significant galaxy overdensities (i.e., protoclusters), with $\delta_{\rm gal} > 5$ within a volume of $V \sim 500~{\rm cMpc^3}$. We also find that $|\Delta v_{\rm los}|$ increases rapidly toward smaller galaxy-quasar separations in protocluster fields, consistent with galaxy kinematics around extremely massive halos in cosmological simulations. By combining JWST and ALMA data, we reveal the complex and diverse environments of these early quasars, providing robust evidence that the earliest luminous quasars are effective tracers of galaxy overdensities, albeit with substantial field-to-field variation.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic voids, the largest underdense regions in the Universe, provide unique laboratories for studying galaxy formation and constitute powerful probes of cosmology. Recent work has shown that individual galaxy bias (b_i), which quantifies how each galaxy traces the underlying dark matter field, exhibits a characteristic radial dependence within spherical voids, defining a void bias profile in which galaxies near void centers display systematically lower bias values. We investigate how the environmental modulation of individual galaxy bias depends on the adopted void-finding algorithm by comparing measurements across five distinct void definitions: spherical voids 'sparkling', watershed-based methods ('zobov' and 'revolver' in two modes), and free-form integrated-density voids ('popcorn'). We apply these complementary void-finding algorithms to the same galaxy sample drawn from the IllustrisTNG simulation (TNG300-1 at $z=0$) and compute individual galaxy bias profiles as a function of distance from void centers. We quantify the correlation between b_i and the membership of the void catalogs and explore how this relationship varies with the integrated underdensity threshold for density-based methods. We find that the radial gradient of individual bias within voids, generally increasing from negative values at the void centers to higher values at the boundaries, is robust across most void definitions. However, density-threshold methods preferentially select galaxies with b_i<0, while watershed methods without density constraints include substantial contamination from high-bias boundary galaxies. The correlation between negative bias and void membership is systematically strengthened as the integrated underdensity threshold becomes less restrictive, with popcorn achieving the highest purity in isolating anti-biased populations.
#### The sub-arcsecond ILT view of the Boötes Deep Field: A link between low-frequency kiloparsec radio morphology and AGN driven ionised outflows

 - **Abstract**
 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) outflows can regulate host galaxy evolution via AGN feedback. Ionised gas outflows have been linked to enhanced radio emission. In the first paper of this series, AGN detected with the International LOFAR Telescope (ILT) at 6" were more likely to host an [O III] 5007 outflow than AGN not detected, although only high-powered jets were ruled out as the origin of radio emission. New wide-field, sub-arcsecond resolution imaging at 144 MHz with the ILT now enables a resolved morphological study of this sample. We present the first wide-field, sub-arcsecond images of the Boötes Deep Field at 144 MHz, detecting 4074 sources in the $\sim$0.3" image with a central sensitivity of 33.8 uJy $\mathrm{beam^{-1}}$. For 47 AGN matched in AGN luminosity, we probe radio emission on kiloparsec-scales to investigate correlations with [O III] outflows. This sample spans $z<0.83$, $10^{40}<L_{\mathrm{[O III]}}<10^{43}~\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}}$, and $10^{21}<L_{\mathrm{144MHz}}<10^{24.5}~\mathrm{W~Hz^{-1}}$. We find that if we detect an AGN on both large-scales (6") and small-scales (0.3"), 90$\pm$7 per cent have an [O III] outflow, compared to 63$\pm$9 per cent of sources detected on large-scales, but undetected on small-scales. Furthermore, 17$\pm$6 per cent of sources without an [O III] outflow are detected on kiloparsec-scales, compared to 51$\pm$12 per cent of sources with an [O III] outflow. This implies a connection between [O III] outflows and kiloparsec-scale radio emission, which is likely AGN-driven. In contrast, AGN without an [O III] outflow are dominated by diffuse radio emission, likely to be associated with star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding how galaxies trace the underlying matter density field is essential for characterizing the influence of the large-scale structure on galaxy formation, being therefore a key ingredient in observational cosmology. This connection, commonly described through the galaxy bias, $b$, can be studied effectively using machine learning (ML) techniques, which offer strong predictive capabilities and can capture non-linear relationships. We aim to incorporate the linear bias parameter assigned to individual galaxies into a ML framework, quantify its dependence on various halo and environmental properties, and evaluate whether different algorithms can accurately predict this parameter and reproduce the scatter in several bias relations. We use data from the IllustrisTNG300 simulation, including the distance to different cosmic-web structures computed with DisPerSE. These data are complemented with an object-by-object estimator of the large-scale linear bias ($b_i$), providing the individual contribution of each galaxy to the bias of the entire population. Our ML framework uses three models to predict $b_i$: a Random Forest Regressor, a Neural Network and a probabilistic method (Normalizing Flows). We recover the full hierarchy of galaxy bias dependencies, showing that the most informative features are the overdensities, particularly $\delta_8$, followed by the distances to cosmic-web structures and selected internal halo properties, most notably $z_{1/2}$. We also demonstrate that Normalizing Flows clearly outperform deterministic methods in predicting galaxy bias, including its joint distributions with galaxy properties, owing to their ability to capture the intrinsic variance associated with the stochastic nature of the matter-halo-galaxy connection. Our ML framework provides a foundation for future efforts to measure individual bias with upcoming spectroscopic surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding dark matter's elusive nature is crucial for the framework of particle physics and expanding the Standard Model. This analysis utilizes the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) gamma ray Observatory to indirectly search for dark matter (DM) by studying gamma ray emission from dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs). Selected for their high ratio of dark matter to baryonic matter, dSphs are useful for this type of search owing to the low background emission. In comparison to previous HAWC studies, we significantly improve our sensitivity to DM from dSphs due to improvements to our event reconstruction and reduced hadronic contamination. We expanded the number of dSphs studied, DM annihilation channels into the Standard Model (SM), and the amount of data collected on each previously studied dSph. We searched for DM signals in each dSph using the latest version of the algorithms used to reconstruct data from the primary detector of the HAWC instrument. We report that we do not detect evidence of DM from dSphs, so we place upper limits for the velocity-weighted DM annihilation cross-section ($\langle\sigma v \rangle$) on the order of $10^{-23}~\text{cm}^3\text{s}^{-1}$ for a DM mass range of $1-10^4$ TeV.
