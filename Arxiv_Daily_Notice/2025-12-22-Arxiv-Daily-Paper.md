#### The Nature of Galactic Spiral Arms

Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16966

 - **Abstract**
 Spiral arms are the defining features of broad morphological classes of disc galaxies, but their nature and influence on galaxy evolution is still under debate. A key diagnostic for their nature is the spiral arm pattern speed: the radial profile of the angular rotation rate of spiral features. This profile determines the location and number of dynamical resonances where peculiar motions and azimuthal metallicity fluctuations in stars and gas can manifest; their precise patterns have the potential to support or reject theories of spiral structure. However, limited observations of this type have been carried out so far, despite an increasing number of theoretical predictions emerging from realistic and detailed cosmological simulations. A systematic observational programme focussed on the resolved kinematics and metallicities of stellar populations around galaxy spiral arms is required to confront these predictions. This calls for wide-area multi-object spectrographs on 12m-class telescopes capable of accurately capturing such data across the full coverage of spiral arms in nearby galaxies.
#### Gravitational wave oscillations in Multi-Proca dark energy models

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational wave oscillations arise from the exchange of energy between the metric perturbations and additional tensor modes. This phenomenon can occur even when the extra degrees of freedom consist of a triplet of massive Abelian vector fields, as in Multi-Proca dark energy models. In this work, we study gravitational wave oscillations in this class of models minimally coupled to gravity with a general potential, allowing also for a kinetic coupling between the vector field and dark matter that can, in principle, enhance the modulation of gravitational wave amplitudes. After consistently solving the background dynamics, requiring the model parameters to reproduce a phase of late-time accelerated expansion, we assess the accuracy of commonly used analytical approximations and quantify the impact of gravitational wave amplitude modulation for current detectors (LIGO--Virgo) and future missions such as LISA. Although oscillations are present in these scenarios, we find that the effective mass scale (the mixing mass) governing the phenomenon is $m_g \sim \mu_A$, where $\mu_A$ is the (time-dependent) effective mass of the vector dark-energy field. Detectability of gravitational wave oscillations, however, requires $m_g \gg H_0$, which is in tension with the ultra-light masses typically needed to drive accelerated expansion $\mu_A \sim H_0 \sim 10^{-33}\,\mathrm{eV}$. Therefore, if gravitational wave oscillations were to be detected at the corresponding frequencies, they could not be attributed to these classes of dark-energy models.
#### A robust morphological classification method for galaxies using dual-encoding contrastive learning and multi-clustering voting on JWST/NIRCam images
 - **Authors:** Xiaolei Yin, Guanwen Fang, Shiying Lu, Zesen Lin, Yao Dai, Chichun Zhou

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17162

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.17162

 - **Abstract**
 The two-step galaxy morphology classification framework {\tt USmorph} successfully combines unsupervised machine learning (UML) with supervised machine learning (SML) methods. To enhance the UML step, we employed a dual-encoder architecture (ConvNeXt and ViT) to effectively encode images, contrastive learning to accurately extract features, and principal component analysis to efficiently reduce dimensionality. Based on this improved framework, a sample of 46,176 galaxies at $0<z<4.2$, selected in the COSMOS-Web field, is classified into five types using the JWST near-infrared images: 33\% spherical (SPH), 25\% early-type disk (ETD), 25\% late-type disk (LTD), 7\% irregular (IRR), and 10\% unclassified (UNC) galaxies. We also performed parametric (S{é}rsic index, $n$,and effective radius, $r_{\rm e}$) and nonparametric measurements (Gini coefficient, $G$, the second-order moment of light, $M_{\rm 20}$, concentration, $C$, multiplicity, $\Psi$, and three other parameters from the MID statistics) for massive galaxies ($M_*>10^9 M_\odot$) to verify the validity of our galaxy morphological classification system. The analysis of morphological parameters is consistent with our classification system: SPH and ETD galaxies with higher $n$, $G$, and $C$ tend to be more bulge-dominated and more compact compared with other types of galaxies. This demonstrates the reliability of this classification system, which will be useful for a forthcoming large-sky survey from the Chinese Space Station Telescope.
#### Using a neural network approach and starspots dependent models to predict effective temperatures and ages of young stars
 - **Authors:** Marco Tarantino, Loredana Prisinzano, Nicoletta D Angelo, Francesco Damiani, Giada Adelfio
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17480

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.17480

 - **Abstract**
 This study presents a statistical approach to accurately predict the effective temperatures of pre-main sequence stars, which are necessary for determining stellar ages using the isochrone methodology and cutting-age starspots-dependent models. By training a Neural Network model on high-quality spectroscopic temperatures from the Gaia-ESO Survey as the response variable, and using photometric data from Gaia DR3 and 2MASS catalogs as explanatory variables, we implemented a methodology to accurately derive the effective temperatures of much larger populations of stars for which only photometric data are available. The model demonstrated robust performance for low-mass stars with temperatures below 7000 K, including young stars, the primary focus of this work. Predicted temperatures were employed to construct Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams and to predict stellar ages of different young clusters and star forming regions through isochrone interpolation, achieving excellent agreement with spectroscopic-based ages and literature values derived from model-independent methods like lithium equivalent widths. The inclusion of starspot evolutionary models improved the age predictions, providing a more accurate description of stellar properties. Additionally, the results regarding the effective temperature and age predictions of the young clusters provide evidence for intrinsic age spreads in the youngest clusters, suggesting multiple formation events over time.
#### CLiENT: A new tool for emulating cosmological likelihoods using deep neural networks

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17509

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.17509

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmological emulation of observables such as the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) spectra and matter power spectra have become increasingly common in recent years because of the potential for saving computation time in connection with cosmological parameter inference or model comparison. In this paper we present CLiENT (Cosmological Likelihood Emulator using Neural networks with TensorFlow), a new method which circumvents the computation of observables in favour of directly emulating the likelihood function for a data set given a model parameter vector. We find that the method is competitive with observable emulators in terms of the required number of function evaluations, but has the distinct advantage of producing a surrogate likelihood which is completely auto-differentiable. Using less than $2 \times 10^4$ function evaluations CLiENT typically achieves credible intervals within better than $0.1 \sigma$ of those obtained using the true likelihood and single-point emulator precision better than $\Delta \chi^2 \sim 0.5$ across relevant regions in parameter space.
#### Surrogate-Accelerated Bayesian Inversion for Exoplanet Interior Characterization

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.17626

 - **Abstract**
 Characterizing the interior structure of exoplanets is an inverse problem often solved using Bayesian inference, but this approach is hampered by the high computational cost of planetary structure models. To overcome this barrier, we present a robust framework that accelerates inference by replacing the computationally expensive physics-based forward model with a fast polynomial chaos-Kriging (PCK) surrogate directly within a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling loop. We rigorously validate our approach using a suite of tests, including a direct comparison against a benchmark MCMC inference using the full forward model, and a large-scale coverage study with 1000 synthetic test cases to demonstrate the statistical reliability of our inferred credible intervals. Our surrogate-assisted framework achieves a computational speedup of over 2 orders of magnitude (factor of $\sim$320), reducing single-CPU inference times from days to minutes. This efficiency is achieved with a surrogate that requires only a few hundred forward model evaluations for training \rev{for a single planet}. This data efficiency provides significant flexibility for model developments and a clear advantage over common machine learning approaches, which typically demand vast training sets ($>10^6$ model runs) and intensive pre-computation. The PCK surrogate maintains high fidelity with $R^2 > 0.99$ for most scenarios, and root-mean-square errors typically an order of magnitude smaller than observational uncertainties. This efficiency enables large scale population studies while preserving statistical robustness, which is computationally impractical with traditional methods.
#### Evolving and interacting dark energy: photometric and spectroscopic synergy with DES Y3 and DESI DR2
 - **Authors:** M. Tsedrik, B. Bose

Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO)

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.17684

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the Dark Scattering (DS) interacting dark energy scenario, characterised by pure momentum exchange between dark matter and dark energy, allowing for a time-dependent equation-of-state described by the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrisation. This class of models is weakly constrained by CMB observations and can exhibit distinctive late-time suppression of structure growth. We derive constraints on cosmological, DS, and CPL parameters using three two-point correlation functions from the Dark Energy Survey Year 3 data, combined with baryon acoustic oscillation measurements from DESI, Type Ia supernovae from DES Year 5, and CMB data from Planck. We find the dark-sector interaction parameter $A_\mathrm{ds}$ to be consistent with zero for all data combinations, and that CPL provides a statistically preferred fit over DS for the selected probes. From the full data combination we obtain $w_0=-0.76\pm0.06, \, w_a=-0.77^{+0.23}_{-0.20}$ for CPL, and $w_0=-0.79^{+0.05}_{-0.06}, \, w_a=-0.56^{+0.24}_{-0.15}, \, (A_\mathrm{ds}=9.8^{+2.8}_{-9.5}\,\mathrm{bn/GeV} )$ for DS. The inclusion of DES photometric information improves the Figure-of-Merit on $(w_0,w_a)$ by $\sim$20% for CPL and $\sim$50% for DS relative to DESI+SN+CMB alone. We find no evidence for an $S_8$ discrepancy in either model. These results provide the most stringent pre-Euclid constraints on DS from a combined photometric and spectroscopic analysis.
#### Interpreting the strong clustering of ultra-diffuse galaxies by halo spin bias
 - **Authors:** Qinglin Ma, Cheng Li, Yangyao Chen, Houjun Mo

Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.17742

 - **Abstract**
 We use the IllustrisTNG300-ODM simulation to investigate the spin bias of low-mass halos and its connection to the strong clustering of ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) reported by Zhang et al. (2025). By comparing two halo spin definitions-one using only bound particles ($\lambda_{\rm b}$) and another including unbound particles ($\lambda_{\rm a}$)-we demonstrate that the spin bias of low-mass halos critically depends on the definition. While $\lambda_{\rm a}$ yields stronger clustering for higher-spin halos at all masses, $\lambda_{\rm b}$ produces an inverted trend below $M_{\rm h}\sim 10^{11} \rm M_{\odot}/h$. This discrepancy is driven by a subset of halos in high-density environments that have large $\lambda_{\rm a}$ but small $\lambda_{\rm b}$. Using an empirical model implemented in SDSS-like mocks, we link the stellar surface-mass-density ($\Sigma_\ast$) of a galaxy to $\lambda_{\rm a}$ of its host halo and find an anti-correlation that more diffuse dwarfs tend to reside in higher-spin halos. The model naturally reproduces the observed strong clustering of UDGs within the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework without invoking exotic assumptions such as self-interacting dark matter. The high fraction of unbound particles in UDG hosts likely originates from tidal fields in dense regions, an effect particularly significant for low-mass halos. We discuss how the angular momentum of a halo represented by $\lambda_{\rm a}$ may be transferred to the gas to affect size and surface density of the galaxy that forms in the halo.
#### Implicit Likelihood Inference of the Neutrino Mass Hierarchy from Cosmological Data

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.17744

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we turn to the Learning the Universe Implicit Likelihood Inference (LtU-ILI) pipeline to perform a multi-round ILI of the neutrino mass hierarchy from cosmological data, including $TT$, $TE$, $EE$ power spectra of Planck 2018 and distance ratios of DESI DR2. More precisely, we first embed the CMB power spectra simulator $\mathtt{CLASS}$ into the LtU-ILI pipeline. And then, opting for Sequential Neural Likelihood Estimation (SNLE), we sequentially train neural networks using $2$ rounds of $5000$ simulations to target a ``black box'' likelihood of our forward model with one additional neutrino mass hierarchy parameter $\tilde{\Delta}$ and six base cosmological parameters. We find that $\tilde{\Delta}=0.12216^{+0.26193}_{-0.29243}~(68\%{\rm CL})$ which slightly prefers $\tilde{\Delta}>0$, hence the normal hierarchy.

 As the fiftieth anniversary of our common effort in the field of relativistic astrophysics is approaching, we offer a new look to some of our acquired knowledge in a more complete view, which evidence previous unnoticed connections. They are gaining due prominence in reaching a more complete picture evidencing the main results. We outline the history of GRB observations along with a summary of the contributions made by our group to develop the BdHN interpreting model. We show the seven Episodes characterizing the most powerful BdHNe I occurred to date: GRB 190114C and GRB 220101A. New inferences for the explanation of the highest energy radiation in the TeV are presented.
