#### How Dark Sector Equations of State Govern Interaction Signatures

 - **Abstract**
 Using late-Universe observations, we demonstrate that freeing dark energy and dark matter equations of state (EoS) dramatically alters the inferred strength and direction of their interactions. When dark sector EoS are fixed to $w_{\mathrm{de}}=-1$ and $w_{\mathrm{dm}}=0$, the data consistently favor an energy transfer from dark energy to dark matter across various interaction forms. This apparent evidence, however, proves highly sensitive to the EoS assumptions: treating $w_{\mathrm{de}}$ as a free parameter substantially weakens the evidence for interaction, with its value converging to the quintessence regime ($w_{\mathrm{de}}>-1$). In contrast, freeing $w_{\mathrm{dm}}$ maintains a preference for interaction, revealing a correlation where positive $w_{\mathrm{dm}}$ is associated with energy transfer from dark energy to dark matter, and negative $w_{\mathrm{dm}}$ with energy transfer from dark matter to dark energy. These findings caution against the simplistic assumption of $\Lambda$CDM EoS values when attempting to detect a possible interaction. Despite these fundamental degeneracies, model comparison using the Akaike and Deviance information criteria shows that all of the tested interacting dark energy scenarios receive substantial support over the $\Lambda$CDM model.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar feedback, as a key process regulating the baryon cycle, is thought to greatly redistribute baryonic material inside and outside the dark matter halos (DMHs), however the observational evidences are lacking. Through stacking analyses of ~400,000 galaxy spectra from Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), we find star formation driven cool outflows in Mg II absorption line. Assuming only gravity acts on the launched gas, our calculations reveal that outflows from low mass galaxies (log M*<10) are capable of escaping beyond the DMHs, which aligns well with our finding in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) absorption along the minor-axes of galaxies using background quasars. This research offers indirect evidence that stellar feedback drives the low baryon retention rate in low-mass haloes, implicating that baryonic processes within galaxies are connected with the diffuse matter beyond the DMHs.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar flares and coronal mass ejections, originating from solar active regions (ARs), are the primary drivers of space weather and can disrupt technological systems. Forecasting efforts heavily rely on photospheric magnetic field data from the Space-weather HMI Active Region Patch (SHARPs) data products. However, the crucial energy release occurs higher in the solar corona. Radio observations from instruments like the RATAN-600 telescope directly probe this region, but their scientific use has been hindered by a lack of standardized and accessible data products. To address this gap, we have developed the Ratan Active Region Patches (RARPs) database, a new public resource of multi-frequency radio spectra for solar ARs. Generated using RATANSunPy software, RARPs provides the first standardized radio counterpart to magnetic field archives. The database contains over 160,000 calibrated AR observations from 2009 to 2025, each including 3-18 GHz spectra and rich metadata. We demonstrate the scientific utility of this database by using machine learning to forecast solar flares. The radio spectra are first compressed into low-dimensional embedded features using an autoencoder, which are then used as predictors in baseline logistic regression classifiers. We compare the predictive power of these embedded RARPs features with that of the 18 SHARPs magnetic field parameters provided in the SHARPs data product headers. Our results show that while SHARPs data provides superior flare discrimination, the radio signatures in RARPs possess clear predictive potential and, for M-class and above flares, yield lower Brier Scores and positive Brier Skill Scores relative to SHARPs, indicating more accurate probabilistic forecasts for these events. This establishes radio data as a valuable and complementary information source.
#### Stellar cores live long and prosper in cuspy dark matter halos

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.05719

 - **Abstract**
 The existence of cuspy or cored centers of dark matter halos is a crucial discriminant between different dark matter models. It has recently been claimed based on dynamical arguments that perfectly cored stellar systems cannot survive inside cuspy dark matter halos, which would make the observation of stellar cores in ultra-faint dwarf galaxies, where dark matter cores cannot form through baryonic processes, a direct falsification of the cold dark matter paradigm. Here, we use idealized simulations to show explicitly that cored stellar systems like those observed in dwarf galaxies can be stable within cuspy dark matter halos over at least several Hubble times. We also demonstrate that observations of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies cannot distinguish mildly positive, flat, or negative inner density slopes, further precluding the dynamical inference of the gravitational potential from the stellar configuration.
#### Exoplanet formation inference using conditional invertible neural networks

 - **Abstract**
 The interpretation of the origin of observed exoplanets is usually done only qualitatively due to uncertainties of key parameters in planet formation models. To allow a quantitative methodology which traces back in time to the planet birth locations, we train recently developed conditional invertible neural networks (cINN) on synthetic data from a global planet formation model which tracks growth from dust grains to evolved final giant planets. In addition to deterministic single planet formation runs, we also include gravitationally interacting planets in multiplanetary systems, which include some measure of chaos. For the latter case, we treat them as individual planets or choose the two or three planets most likely to be discovered by telescopes. We find that training on multiplanetary data, each planet treated as individual point, is promising. The single-planet data only covers a small range of planets and does not extrapolate well to planet properties not included in the training data. Extension to planetary systems will require more training data due to the higher dimensionality of the problem.
#### A redshift-independent theoretical halo mass function validated with the Uchuu simulations

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new theoretical framework for the halo mass function (HMF) that accurately predicts the abundance of dark matter haloes across an exceptionally wide range in mass and redshift. Building on a generalised Press & Schechter model and triaxial collapse (GPS+), we predict the HMF in terms of the variance of the linear density field, with only a weak explicit dependence on halo mass and no explicit dependence on redshift. The GPS+ model naturally provides the correct normalization and high-mass behaviour without requiring empirical fitting. We calibrate and validate the GPS+ model using the Uchuu N-body simulation suite, which combines large cosmological volume and high mass resolution under Planck cosmology. Using six simulations with up to 300 realizations, we obtain precision HMF measurements spanning halo masses in the range 6.5 < log($M_{\rm 200m}$/[h$^{-1}$ $M_{\odot}$]) <16 over 0 < z < 20, with reduced cosmic variance. Across this full domain, the GPS+ model reproduces the simulated HMF with deviations typically below 10-20%. Comparison with the Sheth-Tormen (ST) model shows similar performance at z < 2, but markedly improved agreement at higher redshifts, where ST can deviate by 70-80% while our model remains within ~20%. Finally, we assess the impact of the halo mass definition: adopting the evolving virial overdensity of Bryan & Norman (1998) worsens agreement at low redshift and high masses, whereas M200m yields a more universal, nearly redshift-independent HMF.

 - **Abstract**
 In the era of large-scale surveys like Euclid, machine learning has become an essential tool for identifying rare yet scientifically valuable objects, such as strong gravitational lenses. However, supervised machine-learning approaches require large quantities of labelled examples to train on, and the limited number of known strong lenses has lead to a reliance on simulations for training. A well-known challenge is that machine-learning models trained on one data domain often underperform when applied to a different domain: in the context of lens finding, this means that strong performance on simulated lenses does not necessarily translate into equally good performance on real observations. In Euclid's Quick Data Release 1 (Q1), covering 63 deg2, 500 strong lens candidates were discovered through a synergy of machine learning, citizen science, and expert visual inspection. These discoveries now allow us to quantify this performance gap and investigate the impact of training on real data. We find that a network trained only on simulations recovers up to 92% of simulated lenses with 100% purity, but only achieves 50% completeness with 24% purity on real Euclid data. By augmenting training data with real Euclid lenses and non-lenses, completeness improves by 25-30% in terms of the expected yield of discoverable lenses in Euclid DR1 and the full Euclid Wide Survey. Roughly 20% of this improvement comes from the inclusion of real lenses in the training data, while 5-10% comes from exposure to a more diverse set of non-lenses and false-positives from Q1. We show that the most effective lens-finding strategy for real-world performance combines the diversity of simulations with the fidelity of real lenses. This hybrid approach establishes a clear methodology for maximising lens discoveries in future data releases from Euclid, and will likely also be applicable to other surveys such as LSST.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel graph-based machine learning classifier for identifying the dark matter cosmic web environments of galaxies. Large galaxy surveys offer comprehensive statistical views of how galaxy properties are shaped by large-scale structure, but this requires robust classifications of galaxies' cosmic web environments. Using stellar mass-selected IllustrisTNG-300 galaxies, we apply a three-stage, simulation-based framework to link galaxies to the total (mainly dark) underlying matter distribution. Here, we apply the following three steps: First, we assign the positions of simulated galaxies to a void, wall, filament, or cluster environment using the T-Web classification of the underlying matter distribution. Second, we construct a Delaunay triangulation of the galaxy distribution to summarise the local geometric structure with ten graph metrics for each galaxy. Third, we train a graph attention network (GAT) on each galaxy's graph metrics to predict its cosmic web environment. For galaxies with stellar mass $\mathrm{>10^9 M_{\odot}}$, our GAT+ model achieves an accuracy of $85\,\%$, outperforming graph-agnostic multilayer perceptrons and graph convolutional networks. Our results demonstrate that graph-based representations of galaxy positions provide a powerful and physically meaningful way to infer dark matter environments. We plan to apply this simulation-based graph modelling to investigate how the properties of observed galaxies from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey are influenced by their dark matter environments.

 - **Abstract**
 Weak gravitational lensing has emerged as a powerful tool for investigating the matter distribution in the Universe and how it has evolved over cosmic time. The Wide Field Instrument (WFI) on the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman) will deliver some of the highest precision measurements of weak lensing ever made. Since weak lensing is based on statistics of faint sources, it can be biased by even tiny instrument systematics, including correlated read noise. Previous works have shown the infrared detectors used in the Roman WFI show correlations in their noise fields at a level significant for weak lensing measurements, even after application of standard reference pixel corrections; of particular concern is 1/f noise, which appears as horizontal banding in the detector frame. In this paper, we present imDestripe: a new Python module utilizing the multiple roll angles in Roman's observing strategy and linear algebra techniques to remove correlated noise stripes from observed images. We test imDestripe in a hybrid simulation by combining real noise realizations (from darks taken during ground testing) with simulated images of the astronomical scene, and find that the power spectrum of the banding can be suppressed by factors of 10--30 on large scales. We briefly discuss plans for further development of imDestripe in the context of the WFI pipeline.
