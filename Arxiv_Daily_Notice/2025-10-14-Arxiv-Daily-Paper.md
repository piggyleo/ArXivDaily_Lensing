 - **Abstract**
 Advances in machine learning over the past decade have resulted in a proliferation of algorithmic applications for encoding, characterizing, and acting on complex data that may contain many high dimensional features. Recently, the emergence of deep-learning models trained across very large datasets has created a new paradigm for machine learning in the form of Foundation Models. Foundation Models are programs trained on very large and broad datasets with an extensive number of parameters. Once built, these powerful, and flexible, models can be utilized in less resource-intensive ways to build many different, downstream applications that can integrate previously disparate, multimodal data. The development of these applications can be done rapidly and with a much lower demand for machine learning expertise. And the necessary infrastructure and models themselves are already being established within agencies such as NASA and ESA. At NASA this work is across several divisions of the Science Mission Directorate including the NASA Goddard and INDUS Large Language Models and the Prithvi Geospatial Foundation Model. And ESA initiatives to bring Foundation Models to Earth observations has led to the development of TerraMind. A workshop was held by the NASA Ames Research Center and the SETI Institute, in February 2025, to investigate the potential of Foundation Models for astrobiological research and to determine what steps would be needed to build and utilize such a model or models. This paper shares the findings and recommendations of that workshop, and describes clear near-term, and future opportunities in the development of a Foundation Model (or Models) for astrobiology applications. These applications would include a biosignature, or life characterization, task, a mission development and operations task, and a natural language task for integrating and supporting astrobiology research needs.

 - **Abstract**
 The Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the \emph{Fermi} Gamma-ray Space Telescope has been continuously providing good quality survey data of the entire sky in the high energy range from 30 MeV to 500 GeV and above since August 2008. A succession of gamma-ray source catalogs is published after a comprehensive analysis of the \emph{Fermi}--LAT data. The most recent release of data in the fourth \emph{Fermi}--LAT catalog of gamma-ray sources (4FGL-DR4), based on the first 14 years of observations in the energy band 50 MeV-1 TeV, contains 7195 sources. A large fraction ($\sim$ 33\%) of this population has no known counterparts in the lower wave bands. Such high energy gamma-ray sources are referred to as unassociated or unidentified. An appropriate classification of these objects into known type of gamma-ray sources such as the active galactic nuclei or pulsars is essential for population studies and pointed multi-wavelength observations to probe the radiative processes. In this work, we perform a detailed classification of the unassociated sources reported in the 4FGL-DR4 catalog using two supervised machine learning techniques-Random Forest and Extreme Gradient Boosting. We mainly focus on the identification of new gamma-ray pulsar candidates by making use of different observational features derived from the long-term observations with the \emph{Fermi}--LAT and reported in the incremental 4FGL-DR4 catalog. We also explore the effects of data balancing approach on the classification of the \emph{Fermi}--LAT unassociated sources.

 - **Abstract**
 The evolution of space technology in recent years, fueled by advancements in computing such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), has profoundly transformed our capacity to explore the cosmos. Missions like the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have made information about distant objects more easily accessible, resulting in extensive amounts of valuable data. As part of this work-in-progress study, we are working to create an atmospheric absorption spectrum prediction model for exoplanets. The eventual model will be based on both collected observational spectra and synthetic spectral data generated by the ROCKE-3D general circulation model (GCM) developed by the climate modeling program at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS). In this initial study, spline curves are used to describe the bin heights of simulated atmospheric absorption spectra as a function of one of the values of the planetary parameters. Bayesian Adaptive Exploration is then employed to identify areas of the planetary parameter space for which more data are needed to improve the model. The resulting system will be used as a forward model so that planetary parameters can be inferred given a planet's atmospheric absorption spectrum. This work is expected to contribute to a better understanding of exoplanetary properties and general exoplanet climates and habitability.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the data release of the Ly$\alpha$ Tomography IMACS Survey (LATIS), one of the largest optical spectroscopic surveys of faint high-redshift galaxies. The survey provides 7408 optical spectra of candidate $z \sim 2-3$ galaxies and QSOs in the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey D1, D2 (COSMOS), and D4 fields. The $R \sim 1000$ spectra were obtained using the IMACS spectrograph at the Magellan Baade telescope, with typical integrations of 12 hr. From these spectra, we measured 5575 high-confidence spectroscopic redshifts, of which 4176 are at $z > 1.7$, thereby substantially increasing the number of public spectroscopic redshifts at $z \approx 2-3$ in COSMOS and the other survey fields. The data release includes Ly$\alpha$ transmission fluctuations measured in $4.7 \times 10^5$ pixels, which were used to create 3D maps of the intergalactic medium (IGM) transmission spanning 1.65 deg${}^2$ and $z = 2.2-2.8$ at a resolution of 4 $h^{-1}$ cMpc. These are the largest such maps to date and provide a novel tracer of large-scale structure in legacy fields. We also provide ancillary data including mock surveys. The LATIS data will enable a variety of community studies of galaxy evolution, environments, and the IGM around cosmic noon.
#### Constraints on the interacting holographic dark energy models: implications from background and perturbations data

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08875

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we employ a two-step method to analyze models of holographic dark energy (HDE) and interacting holographic dark energy (IHDE), incorporating three distinct dark energy (DE)-dark matter (DM) interaction terms. First, using the latest background dataset, we conduct a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis to constrain the free parameters of the models. Then, we assess the models against each other using the key background parameters and compare them to the $\Lambda$CDM standard model. Our results show that at high redshifts, the equation of state (EoS) parameter related to the models for both homogeneous and clustered DE cases falls within the quintessence region. However, as we approach the present time, all models except HDE transition into the phantom region, and two models cross the phantom line earlier than others. In the next step, we focus on the evolution of perturbations in DE and DM. Using background and growth rate data, we constrain parameters including $\sigma_8$. We then investigate the evolution of the growth rate of matter perturbations, $f\sigma_8(z)$, and its deviation, $\Delta f \sigma_8$, from the $\Lambda$CDM model. The HDE model shows the best agreement with observational data, while other models predict varying growth rates compared to $\Lambda$CDM. Finally, we demonstrate through Akaike and Bayesian information criteria (AIC and BIC) analysis that the compatibility of models with observational data depends on the type of data used, the DE-DM interaction term, and the assumptions regarding DE homogeneity and clustering. Our results suggest that homogeneous DE models yield more agreement with observational data than clustered DE models.
#### Galaxy Metallicity Gradients in the Reionization Epoch from the FIRE-2 Simulations

 - **Abstract**
 We employ the high-redshift suite of FIRE-2 cosmological hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations to investigate the evolution of gas-phase metallicity radial gradients in galaxies in the epoch of reionization (EoR). Our sample consists of 22 galaxies spanning the redshift range $z \sim 10-5$. We find that galaxies at $z\sim10$ exhibit a median metallicity gradient of $-0.15\,\mathrm{dex\cdot kpc^{-1}}$ with substantial scatter, which gradually flatten to $-0.1\,\mathrm{dex\cdot kpc^{-1}}$ at $z\sim6$, accompanied by a reduction in scatter. In the EoR, metallicity gradients correlate positively with stellar mass: more massive galaxies display flatter gradients with smaller scatter, broadly consistent with recent JWST observations. At fixed stellar mass, galaxies with higher star formation rates (SFRs) exhibit steeper negative gradients, while sSFR shows a strong anti-correlation with gradient slope. Because EoR galaxies in FIRE-2 generally lack significant rotational support, we adopt the ratio of peak-to-peak velocity shear to twice the velocity dispersion ($\Delta v/2\sigma$) as a proxy for the strength of gas flows. We find a strong positive correlation between metallicity gradients and $\Delta v/2\sigma$: galaxies with lower $\Delta v/2\sigma$ (i.e., weaker gas flows) tend to exhibit steeper negative gradients. Furthermore, galaxies with steeper gradients display higher central SFR surface densities, suggesting localized star formation with inefficient interstellar medium mixing that drives inside-out chemical enrichment in galaxy evolution in the early Universe.
#### Identification of molecular line emission using Convolutional Neural Networks

 - **Abstract**
 Complex organic molecules (COMs) are observed to be abundant in various astrophysical environments, in particular toward star forming regions they are observed both toward protostellar envelopes as well as shocked regions. Emission spectrum especially of heavier COMs may consists of up to hundreds of lines, where line blending hinders the analysis. However, identifying the molecular composition of the gas leading to the observed millimeter spectra is the first step toward a quantitative analysis. We develop a new method based on supervised machine learning to recognize spectroscopic features of the rotational spectrum of molecules in the 3mm atmospheric transmission band for a list of species including COMs with the aim to obtain a detection probability. We used local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) modeling to build a large set of synthetic spectra of 20 molecular species including COMs with a range of physical conditions typical for star forming regions. We successfully designed and trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that provides detection probabilities of individual species in the spectra. We demonstrate that the produced CNN-model has a robust performance to detect spectroscopic signatures from these species in synthetic spectra. We evaluate its ability to detect molecules according to the noise level, frequency coverage, and line-richness, and also test its performance for incomplete frequency coverage with high detection probabilities for the tested parameter space, and no false predictions. Ultimately, we apply the CNN-model to obtain predictions on observational data from the literature toward line-rich hot-core like sources, where detection probabilities remain reasonable with no false detection. We prove the use of CNNs facilitating the analysis of complex millimeter spectra both on synthetic spectra as well as first tests on observational data.

 Euclid is expected to establish new state-of-the-art constraints on extensions beyond the standard LCDM cosmological model by measuring the positions and shapes of billions of galaxies. Specifically, its goal is to shed light on the nature of dark matter and dark energy. Achieving this requires developing and validating advanced statistical tools and theoretical prediction software capable of testing extensions of the LCDM model. In this work, we describe how the Euclid likelihood pipeline, Cosmology Likelihood for Observables in Euclid (CLOE), has been extended to accommodate alternative cosmological models and to refine the theoretical modelling of Euclid primary probes. In particular, we detail modifications made to CLOE to incorporate the magnification bias term into the spectroscopic two-point correlation function of galaxy clustering. Additionally, we explain the adaptations made to CLOE's implementation of Euclid primary photometric probes to account for massive neutrinos and modified gravity extensions. Finally, we present the validation of these CLOE modifications through dedicated forecasts on synthetic Euclid-like data by sampling the full posterior distribution and comparing with the results of previous literature. In conclusion, we have identified in this work several functionalities with regards to beyond-LCDM modelling that could be further improved within CLOE, and outline potential research directions to enhance pipeline efficiency and flexibility through novel inference and machine learning techniques.
#### Detecting dark matter substructure with lensed quasars in optical bands

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.09148

 - **Abstract**
 Flux ratios of multiple images in strong gravitational lensing systems provide a powerful probe of dark matter substructure. Optical flux ratios of lensed quasars are typically affected by stellar microlensing, and thus studies of dark matter substructure often rely on emission regions that are sufficiently extended to avoid microlensing effects. To expand the accessible wavelength range for studying dark matter substructure through flux ratios and to reduce reliance on specific instruments, we confront the challenges posed by microlensing and propose a method to detect dark matter substructure using optical flux ratios of lensed quasars. We select 100 strong lensing systems consisting of 90 doubles and 10 quads to represent the overall population and adopt the Kolmogorov--Smirnov (KS) test as our statistical method. By introducing different types of dark matter substructure into these strong lensing systems, we demonstrate that using quads alone provides the strongest constraints on dark matter and that several tens to a few hundred independent flux ratio measurements from quads can be used to study the properties of dark matter substructure and place constraints on dark matter parameters. Furthermore, we suggest that the use of multi-band flux ratios can substantially reduce the required number of quads. Such sample sizes will be readily available from ongoing and upcoming wide-field surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 The Euclid mission aims to measure the positions, shapes, and redshifts of over a billion galaxies to provide unprecedented constraints on the nature of dark matter and dark energy. Achieving this goal requires a continuous reassessment of the mission's scientific performance, particularly in terms of its ability to constrain cosmological parameters, as our understanding of how to model large-scale structure observables improves. In this study, we present the first scientific forecasts using CLOE (Cosmology Likelihood for Observables in Euclid), a dedicated Euclid cosmological pipeline developed to support this endeavour. Using advanced Bayesian inference techniques applied to synthetic Euclid-like data, we sample the posterior distribution of cosmological and nuisance parameters across a variety of cosmological models and Euclid primary probes: cosmic shear, angular photometric galaxy clustering, galaxy-galaxy lensing, and spectroscopic galaxy clustering. We validate the capability of CLOE to produce reliable cosmological forecasts, showcasing Euclid's potential to achieve a figure of merit for the dark energy parameters $w_0$ and $w_a$ exceeding 400 when combining all primary probes. Furthermore, we illustrate the behaviour of the posterior probability distribution of the parameters of interest given different priors and scale cuts. Finally, we emphasise the importance of addressing computational challenges, proposing further exploration of innovative data science techniques to efficiently navigate the Euclid high-dimensional parameter space in upcoming cosmological data releases.

 - **Abstract**
 In the era of exploding survey volumes, traditional methods of spectroscopic analysis are being pushed to their limits. In response, we develop deep-REMAP, a novel deep learning framework that utilizes a regularized, multi-task approach to predict stellar atmospheric parameters from observed spectra. We train a deep convolutional neural network on the PHOENIX synthetic spectral library and use transfer learning to fine-tune the model on a small subset of observed FGK dwarf spectra from the MARVELS survey. We then apply the model to 732 uncharacterized FGK giant candidates from the same survey. When validated on 30 MARVELS calibration stars, deep-REMAP accurately recovers the effective temperature ($T_{\rm{eff}}$), surface gravity ($\log \rm{g}$), and metallicity ([Fe/H]), achieving a precision of, for instance, approximately 75 K in $T_{\rm{eff}}$. By combining an asymmetric loss function with an embedding loss, our regression-as-classification framework is interpretable, robust to parameter imbalances, and capable of capturing non-Gaussian uncertainties. While developed for MARVELS, the deep-REMAP framework is extensible to other surveys and synthetic libraries, demonstrating a powerful and automated pathway for stellar characterization.
#### Extending CSST Emulator to post-DESI era

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.09503

 - **Abstract**
 The recent DESI BAO measurements have revealed a potential deviation from a cosmological constant, suggesting a dynamic nature of dark energy. To rigorously test this result, complementary probes such as weak gravitational lensing are crucial, demanding highly accurate and efficient predictions of the nonlinear matter power spectrum within the $w_0w_a$CDM framework. However, most existing emulators fail to cover the full parameter posterior from DESI DR2+CMB constraints in the $w_0\mbox{-}w_a$ plane. In this work, we extend the spectral equivalence method outlined in Casarini et al. 2016 to use auxiliary $w_0w_a$CDM models for approximating the power spectrum of a target $w_0w_a$CDM cosmology, moving beyond the previous use of $w$CDM auxiliaries. Incorporating this enhanced module, the extended CSST Emulator achieves a prediction accuracy of $\leq1\%$ over the $1\sigma$ confidence region from DESI DR2+CMB constraints for $z\leq3$, validated by additional dynamic dark energy simulations. The emulator's applicable parameter space has been generalized to fully encompass the $2\sigma$ region, greatly enhancing its utility for cosmological analysis in the post-DESI era.
#### Low-redshift constraints on structure growth from CMB lensing tomography

 - **Abstract**
 We present constraints on the amplitude of matter fluctuations from the clustering of galaxies and their cross-correlation with the gravitational lensing convergence of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), focusing on low redshifts ($z\lesssim0.3$), where potential deviations from a perfect cosmological constant dominating the growth of structure could be more prominent. Specifically, we make use of data from the 2MASS photometric survey (\tmpz) and the \wisc galaxy survey, in combination with CMB lensing data from \planck. Using a hybrid effective field theory (HEFT) approach to model galaxy bias we obtain constraints on the combination $S_8=\sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_m/0.3}$, where $\sigma_8$ is the amplitude of matter fluctuations, and $\Omega_m$ is the non-relativistic matter fraction. Using a prior on $\Omega_m$ based on the baryon acoustic oscillation measurements of DESI, we find $S_8=0.79\pm0.06$, in reasonable agreement with CMB constraints. We also find that, in the absence of this prior, the data favours a value of $\Omega_m=0.245\pm0.024$, that is 2.8$\sigma$ lower than \planck. This result is driven by the broadband shape of the galaxy auto-correlation, and may be affected by theoretical uncertainties in the HEFT power spectrum templates. We further reconstruct the low-redshift growth history, finding it to be compatible with the \planck predictions, as well as existing constraints from lensing tomography. Finally, we study our constraints on the HEFT bias parameters of the galaxy samples studied, finding them to be in reasonable agreement with coevolution predictions.

 - **Abstract**
 Dynamically cold stellar streams from tidally dissolved globular clusters (GCs) serve as excellent tools to measure the Galactic mass distribution and show promise to probe the nature of dark matter. For successful application of these tools to observations, it is essential to have an accurate model of stellar stream properties on the Galactic scale. To this end we produce a mock catalog of stellar streams in four simulated Milky Way-like galaxies. We build the catalog with three main components: a model for the formation and disruption of globular clusters based on cosmological simulations, time-dependent potentials constructed with basis function expansions for integrating stream orbits, and an improved particle spray algorithm for efficient generation of stellar streams. We find that the observable widths and lengths of mock streams as a function of galactocentric radius are well described by power-laws for streams beyond 10 kpc. We generate mock photometry for Gaia, LSST, and Roman, and find that the latter two surveys will increase the number of observable stars in GC stellar streams by several orders of magnitude. Our full catalog, containing stream populations across four different galaxy realizations, is publicly available and can be used to study stream population statistics and to calibrate models which use stellar streams to understand our Galaxy.
