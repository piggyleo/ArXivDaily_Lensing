 - **Abstract**
 Aims. We aim to investigate the connection between star formation histories (SFHs) and the inner dark matter density profiles of simulated galaxies. In particular, we test whether the burstiness and temporal distribution of star formation influence the formation of cored versus cuspy dark matter profiles. Methods. We homogeneously analysed simulated galaxies from the NIHAO and FIRE-2 projects. For each galaxy, we derived dark matter density profiles and measured the logarithmic slope in the inner region of the dark matter halo (1-2% of R$_{\rm vir}$). To characterise star formation burstiness, we introduced a criterion based on comparing the star formation rate (SFR) averaged over two distinct timescales. We further quantified the duration of SFHs by computing $M_{\star, \rm post}$ / $M_{\star, \rm pre}$, the ratio of stellar mass formed after versus before the epoch of reionisation at redshift z $\sim$ 6.5. Results. Homogeneous analysis reveals that inner slope versus stellar-to-halo mass ratio trends for NIHAO and FIRE-2 galaxies are in much better agreement than reported in previous works. The burstiness and duration of the SFH explain the scatter in the inner slope versus stellar-to-halo mass ratio relation, revealing that galaxies with above average burstiness and more extended SFHs are more efficient at developing cored dark matter profiles. In contrast, galaxies with smoother SFHs and earlier stellar mass assembly tend to maintain cuspier dark matter profiles. We present an analytic expression that improves predictions for the inner slope using the parameter $M_{\star \rm,post}$ / $M_{\star \rm,pre}$, which reduces the mean squared error in both simulation suites relative to previous formulations based solely on the stellar-to-halo mass ratio.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an improved semi-analytical model to predict density profiles of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) halos and apply it to constrain the self-scattering cross section using SPARC galaxy rotation curves. Building on the isothermal Jeans approach, our model incorporates (i) velocity-dependent cross sections, (ii) an empirical treatment of core collapse, and (iii) enhanced robustness for identifying solutions. These advances allow us to fit a large sample of galaxies, including systems with baryon-dominated centers often excluded in earlier studies. We find that roughly 1/6 of galaxies admit both a core-growth and a core-collapse solution, while the rest favor a unique evolutionary state. Joint constraints across the sample reveal clear velocity dependence: the allowed parameter space forms an L-shaped degeneracy, where both nearly constant, low cross sections ($\sigma_0\sim2\,{\rm cm}^2$/g, $\omega\gtrsim500\,$km/s) and strongly velocity-dependent models ($\sigma_0\sim100\,{\rm cm}^2$/g, $\omega\sim60\,$km/s) are viable. Adopting the core-growth interpretation yields best-fit values $\sigma_0\simeq5\,{\rm cm}^2$/g and $\omega\simeq250\,$km/s. Our constraints are remarkably consistent with previous results derived from a variety of independent probes. Compared to cold dark matter (CDM) models, SIDM outperforms simple adiabatic-contraction profiles and rivals empirical feedback-based CDM profiles, yet shows no correlation with stellar-to-halo mass ratio, a proxy for feedback strength, offering a distinct explanation for dwarf galaxy diversity. Moreover, SIDM does not affect galaxy-halo scaling relations significantly and makes concentration systematically lower. Our results highlight SIDM as a compelling framework for small-scale structure, while future low-mass kinematic data will be crucial for breaking degeneracies in velocity-dependent cross-section models.

 - **Abstract**
 Our Galaxy, Andromeda and their companion dwarf galaxies form the Local Group. Most of the mass in and around it is believed to be dark matter rather than gas or stars, so its distribution must be inferred from the effect of gravity on the motion of visible objects. Modelling efforts have long struggled to reproduce the quiet Hubble flow around the Local Group, as they require unrealistically little mass beyond the haloes of the two main galaxies. Here we revisit this using $\Lambda$CDM simulations of Local Group analogues with initial conditions constrained to match the observed dynamics of the two main haloes and the surrounding flow. The observations are reconcilable within $\Lambda$CDM, but only if mass is strongly concentrated in a plane out to 10 Mpc, with the surface density rising away from the Local Group and with deep voids above and below. This configuration, dynamically inferred, mirrors known structures in the nearby galaxy distribution. The resulting Hubble flow is quiet yet strongly anisotropic, a fact obscured by the paucity of tracers at high supergalactic latitude. This flattened geometry reconciles the dynamical mass estimates of the Local Group with the surrounding velocity field, thus demonstrating full consistency within the standard cosmological model.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate redshift estimates are a vital component in understanding galaxy evolution and precision cosmology. In this paper, we explore approaches to increase the applicability of machine learning models for photometric redshift estimation on a broader range of galaxy types. Typical models are trained with ground-truth redshifts from spectroscopy. We test the utility and effectiveness of two approaches for combining spectroscopic redshifts and redshifts derived from multiband ($\sim$35 filters) photometry, which sample different types of galaxies compared to spectroscopic surveys. The two approaches are (1) training on a composite dataset and (2) transfer learning from one dataset to another. We compile photometric redshifts from the COSMOS2020 catalog (TransferZ) to complement an established spectroscopic redshift dataset (GalaxiesML). We used two architectures, deterministic neural networks (NN) and Bayesian neural networks (BNN), to examine and evaluate their performance with respect to the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) photo-$z$ science requirements. We also use split conformal prediction for calibrating uncertainty estimates and producing prediction intervals for the BNN and NN, respectively. We find that a NN trained on a composite dataset predicts photo-$z$'s that are 4.5 times less biased within the redshift range $0.3<z<1.5$, 1.1 times less scattered, and has a 1.4 times lower outlier rate than a model trained on only spectroscopic ground truths. We also find that BNNs produce reliable uncertainty estimates, but are sensitive to the different ground truths. This investigation leverages different sources of ground truths to develop models that can accurately predict photo-$z$'s for a broader population of galaxies crucial for surveys such as Euclid and LSST.

 - **Abstract**
 Ordinary matter-including particles such as protons and neutrons-accounts for only about one sixth of all matter in the Universe. The rest is dark matter, which does not emit or absorb light but plays a fundamental role in galaxy and structure evolution. Because it interacts only through gravity, one of the most direct probes is weak gravitational lensing: the deflection of light from distant galaxies by intervening mass. Here we present an extremely detailed, wide-area weak-lensing mass map, covering 0.77 deg x 0.70 deg, using high-resolution imaging from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) as part of the COSMOS-Web survey. By measuring the shapes of 129 galaxies per square arcminute-many independently in the F115W and F150W bands-we achieve an angular resolution of 1.00 +/- 0.01 arcmin. Our map has more than twice the resolution of earlier Hubble Space Telescope maps, revealing how dark and luminous matter co-evolve across filaments, clusters, and under-densities. It traces mass features out to z ~ 2, including the most distant structure at z ~ 1.1. The sensitivity to high-redshift lensing constrains galaxy environments at the peak of cosmic star formation and sets a high-resolution benchmark for testing theories about the nature of dark matter and the formation of large-scale cosmic structure

 - **Abstract**
 Scenarios such as the QCD axion with the Peccei-Quinn symmetry broken after inflation predict an enhanced matter power spectrum on sub-parsec scales. These theories lead to the formation of dense dark matter structures known as minihalos, which provide insights into early Universe dynamics and have implications for direct detection experiments. We examine the mass loss of minihalos during stellar encounters, building on previous studies that derived formulas for mass loss and performed N-body simulations. We propose a new formula for the mass loss that accounts for changes in the minihalo profile after disruption by a passing star. We also investigate the mass loss for multiple stellar encounters. We demonstrate that accurately assessing the mass loss in minihalos due to multiple stellar encounters necessitates considering the alterations in the minihalo's binding energy after each encounter, as overlooking this aspect results in a substantial underestimation of the mass loss. We further extend our analysis to the Galactic environment by more accurately incorporating multiple stellar encounters and dynamical relaxation timescales, simulating minihalo orbits in the Galactic potential. Our results show stellar interactions are more destructive than previously estimated, reducing minihalo mass retention at the solar system to ~30%, compared to earlier estimates of ~60%. This enhanced loss arises from cumulative energy injections when relaxation periods between stellar encounters are accounted for. The altered minihalo mass function implies a larger fraction of axion dark matter occupies inter-minihalo space, potentially increasing the local axion density and improving haloscope detection prospects. This thesis highlights the significance of detailed modeling of stellar disruptions in shaping the axion dark matter distribution.

 - **Abstract**
 Dark matter (DM) halos in $\Lambda$ Cold DM cosmological simulations are triaxial. Most exhibit figure rotation. We study 40 isolated halos with stellar disks from the TNG50 simulation suite across $\sim 4$~Gyr to understand whether and how a triaxial halo's tumbling and orientation relative to the disk can drive warps. We measure a warp angle $\psi$ and find even our isolated disks are all at least slightly warped, with each galaxy's maximum $\psi > 1.8^{\circ}$. We perform a modified cross-correlation analysis between $\psi$ and the figure rotation pattern speed, as well as the misalignment between the disk spin axis and (a) the figure rotation axis, (b) the halo minor axis, and (c) the gas angular momentum axis. We use snapshots spanning a lookback time $t_{lb} ~4$ Gyr with 25 linearly-spaced lags from $ 0 - 2.33$ Gyr. We do not find evidence for a consistent lag between the onset of a warp and any of the aforementioned factors on the population level. However, we find significant correlations between individual time-series at various lags. These maximum correlation coefficients were significantly offset from random chance at the population level, suggesting that several of these factors do correlate with disk warping in specific situations. By examining four case studies whose maximum correlation coefficients were significantly higher than random chance, we establish clear qualitative relationships between these factors and warps. While a non-warped galaxy typically shows minimal halo tilt and figure rotation, warped galaxies can have strong/weak tilts and/or strong/weak figure rotation.

#### Tracing Galaxy Evolution in the Nearby Universe: The Role of Dark Matter

 - **Abstract**
 Using a sample of $\sim$126,000 late-type galaxies (LTGs) from SDSS, we analyzed stellar mass as a function of dynamical mass. Stellar masses were estimated using eight SPS models with constant IMFs, while dynamical masses were derived from seven formulations based on Newtonian dynamics and virial equilibrium, incorporating both stellar and gas velocity dispersions. We account for key factors affecting dynamical mass estimation, including inclination, colour, concentration, and Sérsic index. We find that the difference between dynamical and stellar mass ($\Delta \log \mathbf{M}$) ranges from nearly zero to $\sim$95% of the dynamical mass, depending on mass and redshift. $\Delta \log \mathbf{M}$ appears to decreases with increasing redshift, but exhibits a saddle-like shape at low mass and low redshift-especially in disk-dominated LTGs-transitioning into a steep, linear trend at higher masses and redshifts. In the high-mass regime, the behavior resembles that of early-type galaxies. Moreover, our results indicate that this evolution is not discrete but follows a continuous transition between morphological regimes. Dark matter within LTGs is at most equal to $\Delta \log \mathbf{M}$, depending on the impact of the IMF and SPS on stellar mass estimation. Although SPS-based stellar masses do not include the gas component, previous studies have shown that galaxies with log($\mathbf{M_{Stellar}/M_{Solar}}) > 10$ at $z \leq 0.3$ are predominantly stellar-mass dominated. Most galaxies in our sample fall within this regime, minimizing the impact of gas exclusion. Our findings go beyond the scope of single galaxies, providing insight into the nearby Universe and highlighting the influence of dark matter in determining the Universe's structure and evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Third-order statistics provide information beyond two-point measures, but extracting this information requires accurate and consistent modelling. We measure and detect the three-point correlation function and third-order aperture-mass statistics of intrinsic alignments (IA) for galaxies and for haloes with $M_{\rm halo} > 10^{13}\,{\rm M}_\odot$ in the $(2.8\,\mathrm{Gpc})^3$ simulation volume of the FLAMINGO hydrodynamical simulation suite. We model the third-order aperture-mass statistics and show that on large scales both the galaxy and halo samples are well described by the tree-level effective field theory (EFT) of IA across the three dark matter density-shape combinations and a wide range of triangle configurations, with the alignment amplitude consistent with that inferred from two-point statistics. We compare the full EFT to several other models: a version neglecting the velocity-shear term, the non-linear alignment model (NLA), and to a reduced EFT assuming co-evolution relations that follow from the assumption that alignment is linear in Lagrangian space. The first two models yield biased constraints on the alignment amplitude, but the reduced EFT performs remarkably well, achieving a low reduced chi-squared and minimal bias. We examine the redshift and mass dependence of the higher-order bias parameters, finding that the linear Lagrangian bias assumption is approximately satisfied across the explored halo mass and redshift ranges for both galaxies and haloes, suggesting that the galaxies broadly follow the alignment properties of their host haloes. These co-evolution relations can be valuable for photometric shear surveys, where limited constraining power on IA parameters favours models with fewer free parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 Photospheric horizontal velocity fields play essential roles in the formation and evolution of numerous solar activities. Various methods for estimating the horizontal velocity field have been proposed in the past. Aiming at the highest available (and future) spatial resolution (10 km/pixel) observations, a new method the Shallow U-net models (SUVEL) based on realistic numerical simulation and machine learning techniques was recently developed to track the photospheric horizontal velocity fields. Although SUVEL has been tested on numerical simulation data, its performance on solar observational data remained unclear. In this work, we apply SUVEL to the photospheric intensity observations from four ground-based solar telescopes (DKIST, GST, NVST, and SST) with the largest available apertures, and compare the results obtained from SUVEL with the Fourier local correlation tracking method (FLCT). Average correlation indices between granular regions and velocity fields inferred by SUVEL (FLCT) are 0.63, 0.81, 0.80, and 0.87 (0.00, 0.11, 0.16, and 0.10) for DKIST, GST, NVST, and SST observations. Higher correlation indices between the velocity fields tracked by SUVEL and granular patterns than FLCT reveal the superior performance of SUVEL, validating its reliability with respect to solar observational data.

 - **Abstract**
 The nature of Dark Matter (DM) is one of the most outstanding mysteries of modern astrophysics. While the standard Cold DM (CDM) model successfully explains observations on most astrophysical scales, DM particles have not yet been detected, leaving room for a plethora of different models. In order to identify their observable signatures, we use the AIDA-TNG cosmological simulation suite to predict the distributions of gas and neutral hydrogen (HI) in the CDM, Self-Interacting DM (SIDM), velocity-dependent SIDM (vSIDM), and Warm DM (WDM) models. We find that the DM models investigated have very limited impact on the median gas and HI profile of haloes. In particular, for the most massive haloes ($M_{\rm vir}\sim10^{14}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$), we find that DM self-interactions can shallow the central potential and thereby enhance gas cooling. We find that, in all models, the halo-to-halo variation in the HI profiles is explained by AGN feedback, and that the specific characteristics of DM model is largely subdominant. Nevertheless, we detect some systematic difference in the case of SIDM, with more HI surviving close to the centre with respect to other models. We provide fitting functions for the gas and HI profiles. We investigate the galaxy-Ly$\alpha$ cross-correlation function (\galacc) for different halo masses, redshift and observation strategies. We find that at $z=0$ vSIDM can be distinguished from CDM in haloes with $10^{12}\lesssim M_{\rm vir}\lesssim10^{13}\,{\rm M}_\odot$, while SIDM1 can be distinguished from CDM in haloes with $M_{\rm vir}\gtrsim10^{13}\,{\rm M}_\odot$. We estimate that statistically-robust detection requires sampling $\sim160$ haloes with $\sim20$ sightlines each, a task that can be achieved with current and future facilities like WEAVE, 4MOST, PFS, ELT and WST.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy clusters are the largest virialized structures in the Universe and are predominantly dominated by dark matter. The hydrostatic mass and the mass obtained from gravitational lensing measurements generally differ, a discrepancy known as the hydrostatic mass bias. In this work, we derive the hydrostatic mass of galaxy clusters within the framework of Rastall gravity and investigate its implications under two scenarios: (i) the absence of dark matter and (ii) the existence of dark matter. In the first scenario, Rastall gravity effectively reduces the hydrostatic mass, bringing it closer to the observed baryonic mass. The best linear fit yields a slope $\mathbf{M}=1.07\pm0.11$, indicating a near one-to-one correspondence between the two masses. In the second scenario, Rastall gravity helps to alleviate the hydrostatic mass bias. The linear fit between the Rastall hydrostatic mass and the observed lensing mass results in a best-fit slope $\mathbf{M}=1.01\pm0.16$, which is very close to unity. These results suggest that Rastall gravity provides a statistically favorable framework for addressing mass discrepancies in galaxy clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate how the orbital evolution and mass distribution of infalling satellite galaxies shape the phase-space and radial distributions of intracluster light (ICL) relative to the underlying cluster dark matter (DM) halo. Using N-body simulations, we follow the tidal stripping and orbital evolution of satellite galaxies as they are accreted into a live cluster halo, systematically varying satellite-to-host mass ratio and orbital circularity. We measure the specific orbital energy and angular momentum of stripped stellar and DM material, finding that the stripped stars consistently occupy lower-energy and lower-angular momentum regions of phase-space than the stripped DM. The magnitude of this difference increases strongly towards more equal satellite--to--host mass ratios, while the dependence on orbital circularity is weak. We construct a predictive model for the phase-space properties of stripped stars and DM from a whole infalling satellite population and find that the resulting phase-space difference between the components are driven primarily by the characteristic mass of the infalling satellite stellar mass function. We find that the ICL is always more centrally concentrated than the DM. The magnitude of this offset depends on the characteristic mass and increases towards higher characteristic masses. Comparisons with four independent cosmological hydrodynamical simulations show that, once the infalling satellite stellar mass function is matched, the model reproduces the radial stellar-to-DM density profile offsets to better than the inter-simulation scatter. This demonstrates that the radial relationship between the ICL and the DM distribution is largely governed by satellite demographics. With adequate constraints on the infalling satellite population, ICL density profiles can therefore be used as informative tracers of the underlying radial DM distribution in clusters.
