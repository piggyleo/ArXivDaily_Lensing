 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the feasibility and scientific potential of the Cosmic Positioning System (CPS), a space mission concept enabling purely geometric distance measurements to sources at hundreds of megaparsecs by directly detecting electromagnetic wavefront curvature. CPS consists of a constellation of radio antennas distributed across the outer Solar System, operating on baselines of tens of astronomical units. By precisely timing the arrival of repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs), CPS infers source distances via trilateration -- analogous to global navigation satellite systems such as GPS but on cosmological scales. We show that CPS distance measurements could result in sub-percent constraints on the Hubble constant with even a handful of detections, whereas we predict that 10-100 FRB sources are likely visible. We evaluate dominant sources of uncertainty -- wavefront timing precision, interstellar refractive delays, spacecraft positional knowledge, and onboard clock stability -- finding these controllable at required levels using near-term technologies. Our nominal design employs five spacecraft with 8 m deployable antennas, 3-6 GHz receivers with sub-30 K system temperatures, and space-qualified atomic clocks similar to those on GPS satellites, supported by a ground network for ranging calibration and FRB alerts. Beyond cosmic expansion, CPS may enable frontier measurements in astrophysics and fundamental physics, including constraints on small-scale dark matter structure, microhertz gravitational waves (bridging pulsar timing arrays and LISA), and the outer Solar System mass distribution. The most significant viability issue concerns FRB properties at several-GHz frequencies; we recommend observational campaigns to characterize repeating FRBs in this band.

 - **Abstract**
 Modern telescopes generate increasingly large and diverse datasets, often consisting of complex and morphologically rich structures. To efficiently explore such data requires automated methods that can extract and organize physically meaningful information, ideally without the need for extensive manual interaction. We aim to provide a user-friendly implementation of a self-supervised machine learning framework to explore morphological properties of large datasets, based on the BYOL (Bootstrap Your Own Latents) method. By enabling the generation of meaningful image embeddings without manually labelled data, the framework will enable key tasks such as clustering, anomaly detection, and similarity based exploration. In contrast to existing BYOL implementations, astromorph accommodates data of varying dimensions and resolutions, including both single-channel FITS images and multi-channel spectral cubes. The package is built with usability in mind, offering streamlined pipeline scripts for ease of use as well as deeper customization options via PyTorch-based classes. To demonstrate the utility of astromorph, we apply it in two contrasting science cases representing different astronomical domains: images of protoplanetary disks observed with ALMA, and infrared dark clouds observed with Spitzer and Herschel. In both cases, we demonstrate how astromorph produces scientifically meaningful embeddings that capture morphological differences and similarities across large samples. astromorph enables users to apply a robust, label-free approach for uncovering morphological patterns in astronomical datasets. The successful application to two markedly different datasets suggest that the pipeline is broadly applicable across a wide range of imaging-rich astronomical context, providing a user friendly tool for advancing discovery in observational astronomy.
#### Modeling Redshift Uncertainties in Roman Weak Lensing Cosmology

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmological constraints using weak gravitational lensing measurements from the Roman Space Telescope will require a powerful method for modelling uncertainties in the galaxy redshift distribution. In this work, we use an optimized version of the principal component analysis (PCA) to model uncertainties in the full shape of the redshift distributions, a method proposed by \cite{pca_method} and recently used in the Dark Energy Survey Y6 analysis. Here, we implement this new approach within the Roman High Latitude Imaging Survey (HLIS) Cosmology Project Infrastructure Team (PIT) pipeline, namely Cobaya-Cosmolike Joint Architecture (\texttt{CoCoA}). To validate the PCA in mitigating biases on cosmological parameters, $S_8$ and $\Omega_m$, we use a set of redshift distributions from \texttt{Cardinal} generated for a variety of Roman configurations. Overall, when the simulated cosmic shear data vector is not strongly miscalibrated relative to the fiducial one, both the mean-shift and the PCA-based approaches produce consistent cosmological constraints when marginalizing over nuisance parameters. For mild to strong miscalibration, including additional PCs progressively mitigates biases in $S_8$ and $\Omega_m$, and can achieve comparable performance with fewer parameters than the nine tomographic-bin mean-shift model.
#### Towards a general field equation for galaxies and galaxy clusters

 - **Abstract**
 The MONDian theory of AQUAL (AQUAdratic Lagrangian) and the theory of GRAS (GRavitational Anti-Screening) are alternatives to the theory of dark matter. When these theories are applied to galaxy dynamics they are in excellent agreement with observations including the galactic RAR (Radial Acceleration Relationship). However, when applied to galaxy clusters they do not explain the bulk of the missing mass. This manuscript develops a modified version of the GRAS/AQUAL field equation that can be extended to galaxy clusters. It involves just a single free parameter. The new field equation is then applied to a sample of galaxy clusters and checked against modeled galaxies and solar system constraints. Further to this, the modified field equation leads to an understanding of the difference between the galactic RAR and the RAR recently found for clusters.
#### Massive disk galaxies with high surface brightness plus low surface brightness stellar disks, hosted by massive dark matter halo -- a TNG50 simulation study

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09773

 - **Abstract**
 We study massive disk galaxies (total stellar mass$>=10^{11}$ $\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$) from IllustrisTNG50 simulation, and perform 2-D structural decomposition of the galaxies using their idealised, synthetic SDSS images for z=0. We find an interesting sample of galaxies having a central high surface brightness (HSB) stellar disk, surrounded by an extended low surface brightness (LSB) stellar disk, similar to giant LSB galaxies. These massive, double-exponential disk galaxies are found to be hosted by dark matter haloes of $\sim 10^{12} \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ in agreement to observations of such galaxies. Their maximum rotation velocity, an approximate measure of their dynamical mass, lies within $\sim$ (300-500) km/s. The stellar-to-dark matter mass ratio and the baryon-to-dark matter mass ratio of the sample lies in the range of $\sim$ (0.04 - 0.46) and $\sim$ (0.07 - 0.47) respectively. Our results show that cosmological simulations are able to form disc galaxies with HSB plus LSB disks, as in observations.
#### Analysis of Galactic cirrus filaments in HSC-SSP high-resolution deep images using artificial neural networks

 - **Abstract**
 The existence of Galactic optical cirrus poses a challenge for observing faint objects within our Galaxy and dim extragalactic structures. To investigate individual cirrus filaments in the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program public data release 3 (HSC-SSP DR3) we use a technique based on convolutional neural networks and ensemble learning. This approach allows us to distinguish cirrus filaments from foreground and background objects across the entire HSC-SSP, using optical images in the $g$, $r$, and $i$ wavebands. A comparison with previous work using deep Sloan Digital Sky Survey Stripe~82 (SDSS Stripe~82) data reveals that the cirrus clouds identified in this study are highly consistent in location within the overlapping survey region. However, in the deeper HSC-SSP dataset, we were able to detect $4.5$ times more cirrus clouds. Our study indicates that the sky background in HSC-SSP coadd images is over-subtracted, as evidenced by the surface brightness distribution in cirrus filaments and surrounding regions. Objects with surface brightness of $m = 29~\mbox{mag~arcsec}^{-2}$ near large filaments can be dimmed by over-subtraction of $0.5$ magnitude in the $r$ band. This suggests that cirrus clouds should be taken into account in algorithms for estimating the sky background. For practical use, we provide a catalog of filaments and a framework that allows one to train neural network models for segmenting cirri in HSC-SSP coadd images.
