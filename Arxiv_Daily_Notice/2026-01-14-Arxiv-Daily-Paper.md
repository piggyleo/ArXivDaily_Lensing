 - **Abstract**
 We present Sahyadri, a suite of cosmological $N$-body simulations designed to enable precision studies of the low-redshift Universe with next-generation spectroscopic surveys. Sahyadri includes systematic variations of six cosmological parameters around Planck 2018 constraints, with seed-matched initial conditions enabling cosmological parameter derivatives. Each simulation evolves $2048^3$ particles in a periodic box of side length $200$ $h^{-1}$ Mpc, yielding a particle mass of $m_{\rm{p}} = 8.1 \times 10^{7}\,h^{-1}\,M_{\odot}$ in the fiducial Planck 2018 cosmology. This resolution enables robust identification of dark matter halos down to $M_{\rm min} = 3.2 \times 10^{9}$ $h^{-1}$ $M_\odot$, which represents a factor of $\sim$25 improvement over the AbacusSummit suite, and is over two orders of magnitude better than the Quijote and Aemulus suites. We estimate that approximately 40% of DESI BGS galaxies at redshift $z < 0.15$ - roughly 1.6 million objects - reside in halos accessible to Sahyadri but beyond the reach of existing parameter-varying simulation suites. We demonstrate Sahyadri's capabilities through measurements of the matter power spectrum, halo mass function and power spectrum, and beyond 2-point statistics such as the Voronoi volume function and $k^{\rm th}$ nearest neighbour statistics, showing excellent agreement with theoretical predictions and significant sensitivity to $\Omega_{\rm m}$ variations. We implement a custom compression scheme reducing storage requirements by a factor of $\sim$3 while maintaining sub-percent clustering accuracy. Key data products will be made publicly available.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Cosmic voids are underdense regions of the Universe that provide a unique environment to study galaxy evolution in relative isolation. Galaxy triplets in voids are rare systems where local interactions may strongly influence galaxy properties. Aims. We study the stellar populations, morphologies, mass assembly histories, and dynamical properties of six galaxies belonging to two void triplets from the Calar Alto Void Integral-field Treasury surveY (CAVITY): CAVITY5273X and VGS31. Methods. We used integral-field unit spectroscopy and performed full spectral fitting with the FADO code, which models stellar and nebular emission simultaneously. Spatially resolved maps of stellar age, metallicity, and star formation rate were reconstructed using the integrated nested Laplace approximation. Morphological properties were derived using morfometryka, emission-line diagnostics were applied, and mass assembly functions were computed. Stellar masses and metallicities were compared to the mass-metallicity relation for void galaxies. Results. The two triplets show different evolutionary behaviours. CAVITY52731 is a massive quenched galaxy hosting an active galactic nucleus, while its companions and all galaxies in VGS31 are dominated by young stellar populations and recent star formation. Five galaxies experienced rapid stellar mass growth in the last 2 Gyr. Disturbed morphologies, including asymmetries and tidal features, indicate ongoing interactions. Galaxies in CAVITY5273X follow the expected void mass-metallicity relation, while VGS31 members show significant deviations. Conclusions. Our results show that local interactions can drive significant galaxy evolution even in the most underdense cosmic environments.
#### Reconstructing Gamma Ray Burst Energy Relations with Observational H(z) data in Neural Network Framework

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma ray bursts (GRBs) offer a powerful probe of the cosmic expansion history far beyond the redshift range accessible to Type Ia supernovae. However, the calibration of GRB luminosity correlations is hindered by the circularity problem, which arises from assuming a fiducial cosmological model during calibration. In this work, we perform a model independent calibration of GRB luminosity relations using observational Hubble parameter H(z) data from the A220 and J220 compilations, thereby avoiding explicit cosmological assumptions. We employ Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to reconstruct the calibration relation directly from the data. In addition, we implement a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) framework as an alternative approach, enabling a data driven treatment of both statistical and systematic uncertainties. The calibrated GRB sample is used to constrain the Amati relation, and we systematically compare the outcomes obtained from different calibration techniques and datasets. While the Amati Parameters obtained from GRBs caibrated from the ANN and BNN results are consistent with previous low redshifts calibrations using model-independent methods, the BNN approach provides a more robust framework.
