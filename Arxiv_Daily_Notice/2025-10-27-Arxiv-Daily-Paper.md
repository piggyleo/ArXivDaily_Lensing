 - **Abstract**
 We report the first direct measurement of galaxy assembly bias, a critical systematic in cosmology, from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Bright Galaxy Survey. We introduce a novel, cosmology-independent method to measure the halo occupation distribution (HOD) by combining a state-of-the-art group catalog with weak gravitational lensing. For groups binned by total luminosity, we determine the galaxy occupation number $N_{\rm gal}$ from group-galaxy cross-correlations, while weak lensing constrains the average halo mass $M_h$. Applying this to a volume-limited sample at $z{\in}[0.05,0.2]$, we measure the dependence of HOD, $N_{\rm gal}(M_h)$, on large-scale overdensity $\delta_{g}$. Focusing on the satellite galaxies, we find an assembly bias parameter of $Q_{\rm sat}{=}0.05{\pm}0.14$, a result consistent with zero and in tension with many empirical galaxy formation models. Our method provides a robust approach for characterizing galaxy assembly bias to achieve precision cosmology with DESI and future Stage-V surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a study of morphologies, based on deep $u^{*}g^{\prime}i^{\prime}z^{\prime}$ imaging of the Virgo Cluster from the Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey (NGVS), for 3689 Virgo cluster members spanning a mass range of $\sim$$10^{11}M_{\odot}$ to $\sim$$10^5~M_{\odot}$. Our analysis introduces a new, two-component visual classification scheme developed to capture the morphological diversity of galaxies over more than six orders of magnitude in stellar mass. Our morphological classifications use two parameters to describe the global structure and star formation activity of each galaxy. Structural sub-codes denote features such as spiral arms, bars, disks, shells, streams, while star formation sub-codes indicate the form and location of the current star formation activity (e.g., in cores, clumps, filaments, etc). These visual classifications rely on deep $g^\prime$-band images, supplemented by $u^{*}g^{\prime}i^{\prime}$ color images, as well as unsharp-masked images for a subset of objects. We compare our classifications to previous results for bright member galaxies that used more established schemes, finding good agreement. We also measure quantitative classification statistics (e.g., CASGM$_{20}$) for a subset of the brighter galaxies, and present catalogs for some galaxy types of special interest, including structurally compact galaxies, ultra-diffuse galaxies, candidate ultra-compact dwarf transition objects, as well as candidate post-merger systems. These morphological classifications may be useful as a training set in the application of machine learning tools to the next generation of wide-field imaging surveys.
#### Bayesian and Deterministic Neural Network approaches to Faraday Cup calibration and plasma parameter estimation

 - **Abstract**
 We describe a novel scheme for analyzing particle detector measurements when a well-calibrated, similarly instrumented spacecraft is present in a similar orbit. To prepare ground truth from measurements provided by a reference spacecraft, the method uses dynamic time warping (DTW)--a technique often used for pattern-matching in time series data. An artificial neural network (ANN) is created and trained to reproduce this ground truth from measurements at the target spacecraft. Unlike previous approaches, this procedure is insensitive to calibration errors in the target data stream, as the neural network may be trained from poorly calibrated particle spectra or even directly from low-level data in engineering units. We demonstrate a proof-of-concept by training an ANN to estimate solar wind proton densities, temperatures, and speeds from the DSCOVR PlasMag Faraday Cup, using the \textit{Wind} Solar Wind Experiment as a reference. We present both deterministic and Bayesian neural network approaches. Applications for Parker Solar Probe, HelioSwarm, and other missions are discussed.
#### EBOP MAVEN: A machine learning model to estimate the input parameters for analytic fitting of detached eclipsing binary light curves

 - **Abstract**
 Detached eclipsing binary stars (dEBs) are a key source of data on fundamental stellar parameters. Within the light curve databases of survey missions such as Kepler and TESS are a wealth of new systems awaiting characterisation. We aim to improve the scalability of efforts to process these data by developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) machine learning model to assist in the automation of their analysis. From a phase-folded and binned dEB light curve the model predicts system parameters relating to stellar fractional radii, orbital inclination and eccentricity, and the stellar brightness ratio, for use as input values in subsequent formal analysis with the established JKTEBOP analytic code. We find the model able to predict these parameters for a previously unseen test dataset of 20000 synthetic dEB systems with a mean error of 14.1% when compared with the label values, improving to 8.6% against a subset representative of real systems. When tested with the TESS light curves of a set of real well-characterised systems, the model's predictions yield a mean error of $8.7\pm0.7\%$ when compared with label values derived from existing published analyses. Subsequent fitting of the TESS light curves with the JKTEBOP analytic code while using the model predictions as input values finds 27 of the 28 systems achieving a good fit. On the strength of these results, we plan to build a new characterisation pipeline based on the machine learning model and JKTEBOP code with the intention of producing a target catalogue of dEB systems for potential observation with the forthcoming PLATO mission.
#### Exploring the Co-SIMP dark matter model using the 21-cm signal from dark ages

 - **Abstract**
 The redshifted 21-cm signal from the dark ages offers a powerful probe of cosmological models and the underlying dark matter microphysics. We investigate deviations from the standard $\Lambda$CDM prediction, an absorption trough of approximately $-40.6\,\mathrm{mK}$ at redshift $z \simeq 85.6$, in the context of co-SIMP dark matter. The strength of co-SIMP interactions, quantified by the parameter $C_{\rm int}$, enhances the absorption depth and shifts the trough to higher redshifts. For example, a model with $C_{\rm int}=1.0$ produces a minimum brightness temperature of $-50.6\,\mathrm{mK}$ at $z \simeq 86.2$. The 21-cm power spectrum increases with $C_{\rm int}$ in addition to the global signal. We assess the detectability of these signatures using signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and Fisher matrix forecasts. The maximum SNR reaches $\sim 15.7$ for $C_{\rm int}=1.0$ for the global signal. Fisher forecast for $1,000$ hours of integration time shows that this model can be distinguished from a null-signal at $4.3\sigma$ and from the $\Lambda$CDM model case at $1.6 \sigma$, with order-of-magnitude improvements for 100,000 hours of integration. For the 21-cm power spectrum, our forecasts reveal complementary trends; with a modest setup (collecting area of $5\,\mathrm{km}^2$ and 1,000 hours of integration time), the $C_{\rm int}=1.0$ model can be detected at $4.63\sigma$ and differentiated from the standard scenario at $1.78 \sigma$. These findings highlight the potential of the 21-cm cosmology to probe the properties of dark matter and demonstrate that upcoming dark ages experiments, particularly space-based and lunar observations, can offer a promising avenue to test co-SIMP models.
