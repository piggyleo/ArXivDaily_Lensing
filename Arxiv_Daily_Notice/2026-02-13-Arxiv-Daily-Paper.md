 - **Abstract**
 Assuming spherical symmetry and dynamical equilibrium within a given gravitational potential, a dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxy's globally averaged stellar velocity dispersion depends entirely on the shape of its stellar density profile. Thus, the dynamical inference of a dSph's gravitational potential is necessarily sensitive to assumptions about that shape. Relaxing standard assumptions, we fit flexible stellar density models to observations of the Milky Way's known dSph satellites. Considering various choices for the density profile shape and spatial extent of a host dark matter halo, we use the virial theorem to propagate observational uncertainties about the shapes of the inferred dSph stellar density profiles to uncertainties in the inferred dynamical masses. We find that the observed structural diversity of the Milky Way dSph population implies a large range of potential systematic errors (up to factors of 10) associated with standard dynamical mass estimators. We show that accounting for these observational and systematic uncertainties can significantly alter the appearance and behavior of dSph dynamical scaling relations, including enclosed dynamical mass vs. stellar mass and the Radial Acceleration Relation.

 - **Abstract**
 Estimating redshift is a central task in astrophysics, but its measurement is costly and time-consuming. In addition, current image-based methods are often validated on homogeneous datasets. The development and comparison of networks able generalize across different morphologies, ranging from galaxies to gravitationally-lensed transients, and observational conditions, remain an open challenge. This work proposes DeepRed, a deep learning pipeline that demonstrates how modern computer vision architectures, including ResNet, EfficientNet, Swin Transformer, and MLP-Mixer, can estimate redshifts from images of galaxies, gravitational lenses, and gravitationally-lensed supernovae. We compare these architectures and their ensemble to both neural networks (A1, A3, NetZ, and PhotoZ) and a feature-based method (HOG+SVR) on simulated (DeepGraviLens) and real (KiDS, SDSS) datasets. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on all datasets. On DeepGraviLens, DeepRed achieves a significant improvement in the Normalized Mean Absolute Deviation compared to the best baseline (PhotoZ): 55% on DES-deep (using EfficientNet), 51% on DES-wide (Ensemble), 52% on DESI-DOT (Ensemble), and 46% on LSST-wide (Ensemble). On real observations from the KiDS survey, the pipeline outperforms the best baseline (NetZ), improving NMAD by 16% on a general test set without high-probability lenses (Ensemble) and 27% on high-probability lenses (Ensemble). For non-lensed galaxies in the SDSS dataset, the MLP-Mixer architecture achieves a 5% improvement over the best baselines (A3 and NetZ). SHAP shows that the models correctly focus on the objects of interest with over 95% localization accuracy on high-quality images, validating the reliability of the predictions. These findings suggest that deep learning is a scalable, robust, and interpretable solution for redshift estimation in large-scale surveys.
#### Linear Growth of Matter Perturbations Probed by Redshift-Space Distortions in Interacting $Λ(t)$CDM Cosmologies

 - **Abstract**
 In the context of a spatially flat $\Lambda(t)$CDM cosmology, we investigate interacting dark energy (IDE) scenarios characterized by phenomenological interaction terms proportional to the Hubble expansion rate and the dark energy density. Our analysis is performed at both the background and linear perturbation levels, with particular emphasis on the evolution of dark matter density fluctuations. Cosmological constraints are derived from a joint analysis of CMB distance priors, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) from Pantheon+, Redshift-Space Distortions (RSD), and $H(z)$ data from Cosmic Chronometers (CC). Using the linear growth of matter perturbations, we estimate the clustering parameter $S_8$ within IDE extensions of the flat $\Lambda(t)$CDM framework. At the perturbative level, we consider interaction terms of the form $Q_{\text{I}}=\varepsilon a H\bar{\rho}_{\Lambda(t)}$ (Model I) and $Q_{\text{II}}=\varepsilon H\bar{\rho}_{\Lambda(t)}$ (Model II). From the combined dataset, we obtain the constraints $S_8 = 0.870 \pm 0.026$ for Model I and $S_8 = 0.872 \pm 0.026$ for Model II. Finally, we discuss the implications for the coupling parameter $\varepsilon$, taking into account the semi-analytical approximations and observational data employed in this study.

 - **Abstract**
 The quenching of star formation is a crucial phase in galaxy evolution. Although active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback has been proposed as a key driver of this transition, the lack of strong AGN in nearby quenching galaxies raises questions about its effectiveness. In this study, we investigate AGN activity in post-starburst galaxies (PSBs), star-forming galaxies (SFGs), and quiescent galaxies (QGs) at $z<$ 0.2, using multiwavelength data from eROSITA/eFEDS (X-ray), WISE (mid-infrared), and FIRST (radio). We assess AGN incidence and strength across different stages and apply stacking techniques to undetected galaxies to recover average AGN properties. Comparisons between observed luminosity and that expected from star formation (L$_{\rm obs}$/L$_{\rm SF}$) show that PSBs are consistent with star formation dominating their radio and X-ray emission. Although PSBs exhibit a MIR AGN incidence rate twice that of SFGs, their estimated AGN luminosities are small compared to those of MIR AGN in the literature. PSBs overall do not display significantly enhanced AGN emission relative to mass- and redshift-matched SFGs and QGs. While the presence of obscured, low-luminosity AGN in PSBs cannot be excluded, such AGN, if present, could be fueled by residual gas from the preceding starburst and may not play a dominant role in quenching. Our findings suggest that AGN's role in quenching at low redshift is more subtle than violently removing the gas -- the feedback is likely more "preventive" than "ejective".

 - **Abstract**
 By extending the Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF) observations to the F225W band using HST WFC3/UVIS, we measure the rest-frame UV luminosity function (LF) of galaxies at $0.4 < z < 0.7$, pushing into the low-luminosity galaxy regime. In this first paper of a series, we describe the HST Cycle-27 GO-15940 F225W observations and data reduction, and present a corresponding catalog for the Abell 2744 field, which is the most data-rich HFF cluster field. Combining deep Near-UV imaging and the high magnification from strong gravitational lensing of the foreground cluster, we identify 152 faint galaxies with $-19.5 < M_{UV} < -12.1$ at $0.4 < z < 0.7$ through hybrid photometric-spectroscopic redshift selection from the Abell 2744 F225W catalog. Using a sample defined by a $50\%$ completeness cut and applying the maximum likelihood estimation, we derive the best-fit Schechter parameters for the UV LF at $z \sim 0.55$ down to $M_\text{UV} < -13.5$ mag, including a faint-end slope of $\alpha = -1.324^{+0.072}_{-0.074}$. We incorporate a curvature parameter $\delta$ in parameter estimation to account for a possible turn-over at the faint end of the UV LF, leveraging the exceedingly low luminosities probed by our sample. Our results rule out a turn-over brighter than $M_{UV} = -15.5$ at the $3\sigma$ confidence level.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a cosmological analysis of the X-ray-selected galaxy cluster sample from the XXL survey, employing a simulation-based inference (SBI) framework to jointly constrain cosmological parameters and X-ray scaling relations through forward modeling of cluster counts, X-ray observables, and weak-lensing measurements. Our analysis combines X-ray data from the XMM-XXL survey with shear measurements from the three-year shape catalog of the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program. The analysis focuses on the XXL C1 sample, comprising 171 clusters for abundance modeling, a subset of 86 clusters located within the XXL-N region for lensing-based mass calibration, and 162 clusters with X-ray temperature and luminosity measurements used to constrain scaling relations. Using the density-estimation likelihood-free inference (DELFI) algorithm, we construct a forward model with 12 parameters that incorporates the XXL selection function and cluster population modeling and accounts for key systematic effects including cluster miscentering, photometric redshift bias, and mass-dependent weak-lensing bias. Our SBI analysis yields a constraint on the cosmological parameter $S_8 \equiv \sigma_8 (\Omega_{m}/0.3)^{0.5} = 0.867 \pm 0.063$, with an additional 3% systematic uncertainty from neural network stochasticity. The result is consistent with Planck and recent cluster-based measurements. The inferred temperature-mass relation is consistent with self-similar expectations within uncertainties, whereas the luminosity-temperature relation exhibits a slope steeper than the self-similar prediction. From the resulting posterior distribution of the forward model, we derive lensing-calibrated mass estimates for all individual XXL clusters with measured X-ray temperatures or luminosities. These results provide a self-consistent mass calibration for future multi-probe cosmological analyses of the XXL sample.

 - **Abstract**
 Simulation-based inference (SBI) is a powerful inference technique for cases where the exact functional form of the likelihood is not known. A prime example is the likelihood of cross-correlation power spectra of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) fields at low multipoles, $\ell\lesssim 10$. In this paper, we investigate a parity-violating cross-correlation between $E$- and $B$- mode polarization fields using SBI. The $EB$ correlation at low $\ell$ is essential to distinguish between possible axion dark energy and dark matter interpretations of `cosmic birefringence', a rotation of the plane of linear polarization of the CMB, recently reported from WMAP, Planck, and Atacama Cosmology Telescope data. We use neural likelihood estimation to infer the likelihood of the $EB$ correlation at low $\ell$ and show that it is highly non-Gaussian. We then employ neural posterior estimation to constrain the scalar field mass ($m_\phi$), the cosmic birefringence amplitude ($g\phi_\mathrm{in}/2$), and the instrumental miscalibration angle ($\alpha$), from simulated datasets. We find that the posterior on $m_{\phi}$ shows two regimes, with a transition marked by $10^{-32}$ eV, highlighting a strong sensitivity to the scale dependence of cosmic birefringence. To quantify this behavior, we compute the probability $p(m_{\phi} < 10^{-32}$\,eV) for various fiducial values of $m_{\phi}$. We find that $\alpha$ and the contribution of lensed $B$ modes ultimately limit our ability to exclude the dark energy scenario fully.
