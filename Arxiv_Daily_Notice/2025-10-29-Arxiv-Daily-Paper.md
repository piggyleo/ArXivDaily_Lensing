 - **Abstract**
 Distance-based methods involve the computation of distance values between features and are a well-established paradigm in machine learning. In anomaly detection, anomalies are identified by their large distance from normal data points. However, the performance of these methods often hinges on a single, user-selected distance metric (e.g., Euclidean), which may not be optimal for the complex, high-dimensional feature spaces common in astronomy. Here, we introduce a novel anomaly detection method, Distance Multi-Metric Anomaly Detection (DiMMAD), which uses an ensemble of distance metrics to find novelties. Using multiple distance metrics is effectively equivalent to using different geometries in the feature space. By using a robust ensemble of diverse distance metrics, we overcome the metric-selection problem, creating an anomaly score that is not reliant on any single definition of distance. We demonstrate this multi-metric approach as a tool for simple, interpretable scientific discovery on astronomical time series -- (1) with simulated data for the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time, and (2) real data from the Zwicky Transient Facility. We find that DiMMAD excels at out-of-distribution anomaly detection -- anomalies in the data that might be new classes -- and beats other state-of-the-art methods in the goal of maximizing the diversity of new classes discovered. For rare in-distribution anomaly detection, DiMMAD performs similarly to other methods, but may allow for improved interpretability.

 - **Abstract**
 Self-gravitating galactic halos composed of self-interacting dark matter exhibit the formation of a highly dense core at the galactic center--a gravothermal collapse. Analytic models to describe this evolution have been developed and calibrated to numerical simulations initialized with isotropic particle velocity distributions, an assumption not necessarily warranted by the theory of halo formation. Here we study the dependence of the timescale for gravothermal collapse on the velocity distribution. To do so, we consider self-consistent initial conditions for halos with the same density distribution but with different velocity distributions. We consider models with constant anisotropy and with an anisotropy that increases with radius. The velocity distributions that we explore have collapse times that differ from that assuming isotropic distributions by more than a factor of two. We argue that these variations may depend on the global changes in velocity-dispersion profiles in these anisotropic models and not just on the degree of anisotropy.
#### Re-envisioning Euclid Galaxy Morphology: Identifying and Interpreting Features with Sparse Autoencoders
 - **Authors:** John F. Wu, Michael Walmsley
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Machine Learning (cs.LG)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23749

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.23749

 - **Abstract**
 Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) can efficiently identify candidate monosemantic features from pretrained neural networks for galaxy morphology. We demonstrate this on Euclid Q1 images using both supervised (Zoobot) and new self-supervised (MAE) models. Our publicly released MAE achieves superhuman image reconstruction performance. While a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the supervised model primarily identifies features already aligned with the Galaxy Zoo decision tree, SAEs can identify interpretable features outside of this framework. SAE features also show stronger alignment than PCA with Galaxy Zoo labels. Although challenges in interpretability remain, SAEs provide a powerful engine for discovering astrophysical phenomena beyond the confines of human-defined classification.
#### Unsupervised learning for variability detection with Gaia DR3 photometry. The main sequence-white dwarf valley
 - **Authors:** P. Ranaivomanana, C. Johnston, G. Iorio, P.J. Groot, M. Uzundag, T. Kupfer, C. Aerts

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.23776

 - **Abstract**
 The unprecedented volume and quality of data from space- and ground-based telescopes present an opportunity for machine learning to identify new classes of variable stars and peculiar systems that may have been overlooked by traditional methods. Extending prior methodological work, this study investigates the potential of an unsupervised learning approach to scale effectively to larger stellar populations, including objects in crowded fields, and without the need for pre-selected catalogues, specifically focusing on 13 405 sources selected from Gaia DR3 and lying in the selected region of the CMD. Our methodology incorporates unsupervised clustering techniques based primarily on statistical features extracted from Gaia DR3 epoch photometry. We used the t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE) algorithm to identify variability classes, their subtypes, and spurious variability induced by instrumental effects. The clustering results revealed distinct groups, including hot subdwarfs, cataclysmic variables (CVs), eclipsing binaries, and objects in crowded fields, such as those in the Andromeda (M31) field. Several potential stellar subtypes also emerged within these clusters. Notably, objects previously labelled as RR Lyrae were found in an unexpected region of the CMD, potentially due to either unreliable astrometric measurements (e.g., due to binarity) or alternative evolutionary pathways. This study emphasises the robustness of the proposed method in finding variable objects in a large region of the Gaia CMD, including variable hot subdwarfs and CVs, while demonstrating its efficiency in detecting variability in extended stellar populations. The proposed unsupervised learning framework demonstrates scalability to large datasets and yields promising results in identifying stellar subclasses.
#### Does Machine Learning Work? A Comparative Analysis of Strong Gravitational Lens Searches in the Dark Energy Survey
 - **Authors:** J. Gonzalez, T. Collett, K. Rojas, K. Bechtol, J. A. Acevedo Barroso, A. Melo, A. More, D. Sluse, C. Tortora, P. Holloway, N. E. P. Lines, A. Verma

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.23782

 - **Abstract**
 We present a systematic comparison of three independent machine learning (ML)-based searches for strong gravitational lenses applied to the Dark Energy Survey (Jacobs et al. 2019a,b; Rojas et al. 2022; Gonzalez et al. 2025). Each search employs a distinct ML architecture and training strategy, allowing us to evaluate their relative performance, completeness, and complementarity. Using a visually inspected sample of 1651 systems previously reported as lens candidates, we assess how each model scores these systems and quantify their agreement with expert classifications. The three models show progressive improvement in performance, with F1-scores of 0.31, 0.35, and 0.54 for Jacobs, Rojas, and Gonzalez, respectively. Their completeness for moderate- to high-confidence lens candidates follows a similar trend (31%, 52%, and 70%). When combined, the models recover 82% of all such systems, highlighting their strong complementarity. Additionally, we explore ensemble strategies: average, median, linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and an Independent Bayesian method. We find that all but averaging achieve higher maximum F1 scores than the best individual model, with some ensemble methods improving precision by up to a factor of six. These results demonstrate that combining multiple, diverse ML classifiers can substantially improve the completeness of lens samples while drastically reducing false positives, offering practical guidance for optimizing future ML-based strong lens searches in wide-field surveys.
#### CSST Slitless Spectra: Target Detection and Classification with YOLO
 - **Authors:** Yingying Zhou, Chao Liu, Hao Tian, Xin Zhang, Nan Li

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24087

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.24087

 - **Abstract**
 Addressing the spatial uncertainty and spectral blending challenges in CSST slitless spectroscopy, we present a deep learning-driven, end-to-end framework based on the You Only Look Once (YOLO) models. This approach directly detects, classifies, and analyzes spectral traces from raw 2D images, bypassing traditional, error-accumulating pipelines. YOLOv5 effectively detects both compact zero-order and extended first-order traces even in highly crowded fields. Building on this, YOLO11 integrates source classification (star/galaxy) and discrete astrophysical parameter estimation (e.g., redshift bins), showcasing complete spectral trace analysis without other manual preprocessing. Our framework processes large images rapidly, learning spectral-spatial features holistically to minimize errors. We achieve high trace detection precision (YOLOv5) and demonstrate successful quasar identification and binned redshift estimation (YOLO11). This study establishes machine learning as a paradigm shift in slitless spectroscopy, unifying detection, classification, and preliminary parameter estimation in a scalable system. Future research will concentrate on direct, continuous prediction of astrophysical parameters from raw spectral traces.
#### Self-supervised Synthetic Pretraining for Inference of Stellar Mass Embedded in Dense Gas

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar mass is a fundamental quantity that determines the properties and evolution of stars. However, estimating stellar masses in star-forming regions is challenging because young stars are obscured by dense gas and the regions are highly inhomogeneous, making spherical dynamical estimates unreliable. Supervised machine learning could link such complex structures to stellar mass, but it requires large, high-quality labeled datasets from high-resolution magneto-hydrodynamical (MHD) simulations, which are computationally expensive. We address this by pretraining a vision transformer on one million synthetic fractal images using the self-supervised framework DINOv2, and then applying the frozen model to limited high-resolution MHD simulations. Our results demonstrate that synthetic pretraining improves frozen-feature regression stellar mass predictions, with the pretrained model performing slightly better than a supervised model trained on the same limited simulations. Principal component analysis of the extracted features further reveals semantically meaningful structures, suggesting that the model enables unsupervised segmentation of star-forming regions without the need for labeled data or fine-tuning.
