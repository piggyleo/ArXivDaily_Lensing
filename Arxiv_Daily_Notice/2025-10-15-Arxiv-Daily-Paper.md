 - **Abstract**
 Rest-frame optical observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have uncovered a population of massive galaxies, exceeding $10^{10}$ solar masses, present less than a billion years after the Big Bang. The large stellar masses of these galaxies require an efficient conversion of baryons into stars, which may exceed theoretical expectations. However, the formation process of massive galaxies so early in the Universe's history is perplexing, as observations provide limited information to constrain their evolutionary pathways. Here, we present multi-wavelength observations of a galaxy complex consisting of at least five galaxies within a $\sim10\,{\rm kpc}$ region, referred to as the \quintet, using JWST and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. This system, located in the core of a galaxy protocluster at approximately 650 million years after the Big Bang, reveals the detailed physical processes involved in the formation of massive galaxies. These processes include a dynamic cycles of merger induced gas stripping, leading the temporal termination of star formation, and recycling of the stripped gas, with subsequent enhancement of star formation in other galaxies of the system, which is expected to evolve into massive galaxies that host more than $10^{10}$ solar masses of stars. The new observations represent the first comprehensive evidence of a massive galaxy formation through gas-rich, multiple-galaxy mergers induced by a dense protocluster environment in the $650\,{\rm Myrs}$ after the Big Bang. Our results suggest that the protocluster core is indeed one of the main drivers of efficient galaxy formation and rapid evolution in the early Universe, as predicted by theoretical studies.

 - **Abstract**
 Observed rotation curves of dwarf galaxies exhibit significant diversity at fixed halo mass, challenging galaxy formation within the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) model. Previous cosmological galaxy formation simulations with baryonic physics fail to reproduce the full diversity of rotation curves, suggesting either that there is a flaw in baryonic feedback models, or that an alternative to CDM must be invoked. In this work, we use the Marvelous Massive Dwarf zoom-in simulations, a suite of high-resolution dwarf simulations with $M_{200}~\sim 10^{10}-10^{11}$ ${\rm M}_{\odot}$ and $M_{*}\sim 10^{7}-10^{9}$ ${\rm M}_{\odot}$, designed to target the mass range where galaxy rotation curve diversity is maximized, i.e., between $V_{\rm max} \sim 70-100~ {\rm km/s}$. We add to this a set of low-mass galaxies from the Marvel Dwarf Zoom Volumes to extend the galaxy mass range to lower values. Our fiducial star formation and feedback models produce simulated dwarfs with a broader range of rotation curve shapes, similar to observations. These are the first simulations that can both create dark matter cores via baryonic feedback, reproducing the slower rising rotation curves, while also allowing for compact galaxies and steeply rising rotation curves. Our simulated dwarfs also reproduce the observed size$-M_*$ relation, including scatter, producing both extended and compact dwarfs for the first time in simulated field dwarfs. We explore star formation and feedback models and conclude that previous simulations may have had feedback that was too strong to produce compact dwarfs.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the properties of the first generation of galaxies is an ongoing challenge in observational astrophysics. While advances in deep field observation have led to the identification of large numbers of galaxies within the Epoch of Reionization, there are very few observed galaxies at this range that are sufficiently bright for high signal-to-noise spectroscopy. To this end, we analyse HST and ground-based photometry of five candidate strongly lensed galaxies, all projected behind the cores of massive clusters and with similarly red optical-NIR colors. All are characterized by a drop-off in their spectra between the near-infrared and optical wavelengths, corresponding to a Lyman-break that sets a lower bound on their redshifts. Using the open-source SED modeling software Prospector, we characterize two of these galaxies as high-z (z $\sim$ 6.5-7) while the other three are low-z (z $\sim$ 2) despite all five having similar apparent magnitudes at the observed wavelengths. We demonstrate that for the brightest dropout candidates we can distinguish high-z galaxies from red or dusty low-z galaxies using limited photometric data. The bright sources enable deep constraints on the dropout color which, in combination with flat continua measured in redder bands, require high-z solutions when searching the parameter space. At the time of writing this work significantly increases the number of m_AB < 24 galaxies at or above a redshift of 6, and provides a path forward for future analysis on the early era of galaxy formation

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy mergers play an important role in many aspects of galaxy evolution, therefore, more accurate merger identifications are paramount for achieving a complete understanding of galaxy evolution. As we enter the era of very large imaging surveys, we are able to observe mergers extending to even lower masses and higher redshifts. Despite low-mass galaxies being more common, many previous merger identification methods were mostly calibrated for high-mass, local galaxies, which are easier to identify. To prepare for upcoming surveys, we train a convolutional neural network (CNN) using mock $\textit{HST}$ CANDELS images at $z \sim 1$ created from the IllustrisTNG50 cosmological simulation. We successfully identify galaxy mergers between a wide range of galaxies ($10^8M_\odot < M_\star < 10^{12.5}M_\odot$, and $\mu >1:10$), achieving overall accuracy, purity, and completeness of $\sim73\%$. We show, for the first time, that a CNN trained on this diverse set of galaxies is capable of identifying both major and minor mergers, early and late stage mergers, as well as nonmerging galaxies, similar to that of networks trained at lower redshifts and/or higher masses (with accuracies ranging between $66-80\%$) for the first time. We discuss the inherent limits of galaxy merger identification due to orientation angle and explore the confounding variables, such as star formation, to consider when applying to real data. This network enables the exploration of the impact of previously overlooked mergers of high mass ratio and low stellar masses on galaxy evolution in CANDELS, and can be expanded to surveys from $\textit{JWST}$, Rubin, $\textit{Roman}$, and $\textit{Euclid}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Many different scientific applications require sub-micro arcsecond precision astrometry, including researching rocky exoplanets in the vicinity of the Sun and studying dark matter. The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) is a promising candidate to carry an astrometric instrument because it provides a stable, space-based telescope with a large aperture, which allows faint sources and small displacements to be observed. This paper presents the characterization of an appropriate detector for an astrometric instrument: the 46Mpx Gigapyx from Pyxalis. Moreover it explains the implementation of a testbed enabling interferometric characterization of pixel positions. Finally, the paper introduces a method for calibrating the telescope's optical distortion. This method was implemented in simulation and tested thanks to an optical bench developed at IPAG in France.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmological models where dark matter interacts with dark energy via a pure momentum transfer and with no energy exchange (i.e. elastic) provide compelling scenarios for addressing the apparent lack of structures at low redshift. In particular, it has been shown that measurements of $S_8$ may show a statistically significant preference for the presence of elastic interactions. In this work we implement a specific realisation of these scenarios into an $N$-body code to explore the non-linear regime. We include two populations of particles to describe the interacting dark matter and the non-interacting baryons respectively. On linear scales we recover the suppression of structures obtained from Boltzmann codes, while non-linear scales exhibit an enhancement of the matter power. We find that fewer massive halos are formed at low redshift as a consequence of the elastic interaction and that dark matter halos are more compact than in the standard model. Furthermore, the ratio of dark matter and baryons density profiles is not constant. Finally, we corroborate that baryons efficiently cluster around dark matter halos so they provide good tracers of the dark matter velocity field despite the presence of the interaction. This shows that the interaction is not sufficiently strong as to disrupt virialised structures.

 - **Abstract**
 The advent of Stage IV galaxy redshift surveys such as DESI and Euclid marks the beginning of an era of precision cosmology, with one key objective being the detection of primordial non-Gaussianities (PNG), potential signatures of inflationary physics. In particular, constraining the amplitude of local-type PNG, parameterised by $f_{\rm NL}$, with $\sigma_{f_{\rm NL}} \sim 1$, would provide a critical test of single versus multi-field inflation scenarios. While current large-scale structure and cosmic microwave background analyses have achieved $\sigma_{f_{\rm NL}} \sim 5$-$9$, further improvements demand novel data compression strategies. We propose a hybrid estimator that hierarchically combines standard $2$-point and $3$-point statistics with a field-level neural summary, motivated by recent theoretical work that shows that such a combination is nearly optimal, disentangling primordial from late-time non-Gaussianity. We employ PatchNet, a convolutional neural network that extracts small-scale information from sub-volumes (patches) of the halo number density field while large-scale information is retained via the power spectrum and bispectrum. Using Quijote-PNG simulations, we evaluate the Fisher information of this combined estimator across various redshifts, halo mass cuts, and scale cuts. Our results demonstrate that the inclusion of patch-based field-level compression always enhances constraints on $f_{\rm NL}$, reaching gains of $30$-$45\%$ at low $k_{\rm max}$ ($\sim 0.1 \, h \, \text{Mpc}^{-1}$), and capturing information beyond the bispectrum. This approach offers a computationally efficient and scalable pathway to tighten the PNG constraints from forthcoming survey data.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the MaNGA Visual Morphology (MVM) catalogue, featuring a visual morphological classification of 10,059 galaxies in the final MaNGA sample. By combining SDSS and DESI Legacy Survey (DLS) images, we classified galaxies into 13 Hubble types, detected tidal features, categorized bars into different families, and estimated concentration, asymmetry, and clumpiness. The depth of the DLS images allowed us to identify structural details that were not evident in the SDSS images, resulting in a more reliable classification. After correcting for volume completeness, we find a bimodal distribution in galaxy morphology, with peaks in S0 and Scd types, and a transition zone around S0a-Sa types. Bars are present in 54% of disc galaxies with inclinations < 70, following a bimodal trend with peaks in Sab-Sb and Scd-Sd types. Tidal structures are identified in ~13% of galaxies, particularly in massive E-Sa and low-mass Sdm-Irr galaxies. We derive the galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) and decompose it into each morphological type. Schechter functions accurately describe the latter, while a triple Schechter function describes the total GSMF, associating three characteristic masses with different galaxy types. The abundance of early-type galaxies remains constant at low masses; they are predominantly satellites. We confirm that later-type galaxies are generally younger, bluer, more star-forming, and less metal-rich compared to early-type galaxies. Additionally, we find evidence connecting morphology and stellar mass to the star formation history of galaxies. The MVM catalogue provides a robust dataset for investigating galaxy evolution, secular processes, and machine learning-based morphological classifications.
