 - **Abstract**
 Globular cluster stellar streams probe galaxy-formation processes and can potentially reveal the distribution of dark matter in galaxies. In many theoretical studies, streams are modeled with particle-spray or direct N-body codes. But particle-spray methods abstract away the internal dynamics of the progenitor by making strong assumptions about the escape physics, while direct N-body is prohibitively expensive for realistic (N>10^5) systems. In this paper, we present the stream-modeling capabilities of KRIOS, a new basis-expansion N-body code for collisional stellar dynamics, that bridges this runtime vs. accuracy gap. We show that KRIOS reproduces NBODY6++GPU cluster models, and their associated streams, more accurately than particle spray in a fraction of the NBODY6++GPU wall-clock time. We then compare KRIOS to various particle-spray methods on 10 orbits similar to known Milky Way streams. The morphology and kinematics of these streams most disagree when the progenitor is tightly bound to the host, as these systems are often subject to stronger tidal forces. Finally, we discuss which elements of the progenitor physics are most important for modeling stellar streams and how these might be incorporated into particle-spray methods.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy evolution is shaped by star formation and stellar feedback at scales unresolved by current high-resolution cosmological simulations. Precise subgrid models are thus necessary, and different approaches have been developed. However, they are degenerate and often primarily calibrated to reproduce stellar masses from observations. To explore these degeneracies, we perform three cosmological zoom-in radiation-hydrodynamics simulations of the same galaxy within a $5\times10^{11}\rm\ M_\odot$ dark matter halo at $z\sim1$, each with a different subgrid model: mechanical feedback, a combination of mechanical feedback and thermal feedback, and delayed cooling. We calibrate the simulations to match in stellar mass, isolating the effect of the models on the circumgalactic medium (CGM). Our findings demonstrate that despite producing galaxies with comparable stellar masses, the three models lead to distinct feedback modes, resulting in notable variations in the CGM properties. The delayed cooling run is dominated by ejective feedback and exhibits high burstiness, whereas mechanical and the hybrid models primarily feature preventive feedback, respectively acting at the galaxy and halo scales. Delayed cooling reduces the baryon mass to half the universal baryon fraction while mechanical feedback retains most baryons, with the hybrid model standing in between. Delayed cooling also ejects significantly more metals into the CGM than both other models. While for delayed cooling and mechanical feedback metals are almost evenly distributed in the CGM, they are concentrated around satellites in the hybrid model. These discrepancies emphasize the need to design an appropriate subgrid model to understand how stellar feedback regulates galaxy growth.
#### New Dynamical Measurements from a Lensed Quasar Sample: Joint Analysis Constrains the Mass Profile Evolution of Lens Galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 We present a systematic study of the internal mass structure of early-type galaxies (ETGs) based on 106 galaxy-scale strong gravitational lenses with background quasars, all having spectroscopic redshifts. From this parent sample, we select 24 systems with high-quality ancillary data for joint analysis of strong lensing geometry and stellar kinematics. A key contribution is the derivation of new single-aperture stellar velocity dispersions for 11 lens galaxies via an iterative spectroscopic fitting procedure that mitigates quasar contamination, providing previously unavailable data. We model the total mass-density profile as a power law, $\rho \propto r^{-\gamma}$, and parameterise its logarithmic slope as $\gamma = \gamma_0 + \gamma_z \cdot z_l + \gamma_s \cdot \log \tilde{\Sigma}$, where $z_l$ is the lens redshift and $\tilde{\Sigma}$ the surface mass density. Within a flat $\Lambda$CDM framework and using DESI BAO measurements as a prior, we constrain the parameters via Monte Carlo nested sampling to $\gamma_0 = 1.62^{+0.11}_{-0.12}$, $\gamma_z = -0.35^{+0.08}_{-0.09}$, and $\gamma_s = 0.37^{+0.08}_{-0.07}$ ($68\%$ confidence intervals). Our results robustly demonstrate that $\gamma$ increases with surface mass density ($\gamma_s > 0$) and decreases with redshift ($\gamma_z < 0$). This implies that, at fixed redshift, galaxies with denser stellar cores have steeper mass profiles, while at fixed density, profiles become shallower at higher redshifts. By successfully applying the joint lensing--dynamics method to a substantial, independently acquired sample of lensed quasars, this work provides crucial validation of structural trends previously observed in galaxy--galaxy lensing systems, reinforcing the established evolutionary picture for massive ETGs and establishing lensed quasars as a potent probe of galaxy structure.
#### LIGHTS. The Thin Encircling Stellar Stream of NGC 3938

 - **Abstract**
 We present a stellar stream found in images of the nearby, nearly face-on, late-type galaxy, NGC 3938 obtained for the LBT Imaging of Galactic Halos and Tidal Structures (LIGHTS) survey that is thin, has very low mean surface brightness ($\langle\mu_g\rangle \approx$ 28.7 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ and $\langle\mu_r\rangle \approx$ 28.1 mag arcsec$^{-2}$), appears to lie nearly on the plane of the sky, and wraps more than half way around a host galaxy that is otherwise apparently isolated. We estimate that the progenitor had a stellar mass of $\sim 3.7\times 10^7$ M$_\odot$. Despite an intriguing apparent offset between the centroid of the host galaxy and the apparent center of the stream orbit, we find that we can reproduce the morphology, including this apparent off-centering, with simple models and standard assumptions about the host (thin disk centered within a canonical spherical dark matter halo) and the progenitor satellite orbit. We identify a number of detailed features of the stream, such as changes in curvature and density, that will require more complex models to reproduce. Even this rather simple system provides a rich set of constraints with which to explore the accretion history and gravitational potential of an otherwise unremarkable late-type galaxy. Given the depth of the LIGHTS images, this system is an example of the types of stellar stream that could be found in a majority of nearby giant galaxies with the 10-year stack of Rubin/LSST data.

 - **Abstract**
 Foreground masking and incomplete sky coverage complicate CMB polarization analyses by inducing mode coupling and imperfect E/B separation, with particularly strong impact on searches for primordial $B$-modes. We present SkyReconNet-P, a convolutional neural network for inpainting CMB polarization maps that extends the SkyReconNet framework to jointly reconstruct the polarization $(Q,U)$ maps from partial-sky observations. The method combines regional processing with a hybrid design, utilizing standard convolution and dilated convolution to do a multiscale feature integration. We evaluate performance at both the map and power spectrum level using two masking scenarios: a generated random mask and the Planck 2018 common polarization inpainting mask. For both masking scenarios, SkyReconNet-P reproduces the large-scale morphology of the target maps. In power-spectrum space, we find that the reconstructed $E$-mode spectrum closely tracks the target at low multipoles, while small biases emerge at higher $\ell$. For $B$-mode, the raw reconstructed spectra exhibit a larger multipole-dependent bias, which we mitigate using a simulation-based linear calibration. We show that the calibrated $B$-mode spectrum preserve more information by comparing it with spectrum estimation using pseudo-$C_\ell$. Finally, we demonstrate cosmological parameter inference from calibrated reconstructed spectra by fitting $(r, A_{\rm lens})$ with a Gaussian bandpower likelihood, recovering posteriors consistent with injected parameters across three test ensembles down to $r \sim 10^{-3}$. These results support inpainting as a complementary route to cut-sky approaches when downstream pipelines can greatly benefit from statistically well-characterized, gap-filled polarization maps.
#### Bayesian Cosmic Void Finding with Graph Flows

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic voids contain higher-order cosmological information and are of interest for astroparticle physics. Finding genuine matter underdensities in sparse galaxy surveys is, however, an underconstrained problem. Traditional void finding algorithms produce deterministic void catalogs, neglecting the probabilistic nature of the problem. We present a method to sample from the stochastic mapping from galaxy catalogs to arbitrary void definitions. Our algorithm uses a deep graph neural network to evolve "test particles" according to a flow-matching objective. We demonstrate the method in a simplified example setting but outline steps to generalize it towards practically usable void finders. Trained on a deterministic teacher, the model performs well but has considerable stochasticity which we interpret as regularization. Cosmological information in the predicted void catalogs outperforms the teacher. On the one hand, our method can cheaply emulate existing void finders with apparently useful regularization. More importantly, it also allows us to find the Bayes-optimal mapping between observed galaxies and any void definition. This includes definitions operating at the level of simulated matter density and velocity fields.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate whether a non-minimal coupling between dark matter and gravity can influence the internal dynamics of ultra-diffuse galaxies. Within this framework, the gravitational potential is modified by an additional term that captures the interaction between spacetime curvature and the dark matter with a coupling constant determined by a length scale $L$. Using spherical Jeans modeling, we analyze the kinematic data of three ultra-diffuse galaxies namely: NGC\;1052-DF2, NGC\;1052-DF4, and Dragonfly\;44, which span the observational extremes from dark matter deficient to dark matter dominated systems. For each galaxy we explore several dark matter halo profiles, two orbital anisotropy models, and both with and without Stellar-to-Halo Mass Relation scenarios, and we perform a Bayesian parameter inference. Our results show that across all the considered configurations, the constrained astrophysical parameters are consistent with standard ones from General Relativity. The posterior distributions of $L$ show no preference for non-zero values and result only in upper limits, suggesting that any non-minimal coupling contribution must be small and perturbative on this scales. Future high precision velocity measurements will be essential to determine whether non-minimal coupling effects can become observationally distinguishable in low-acceleration systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Cross-survey generalization is a critical challenge in stellar spectral analysis, particularly in cases such as transferring from low- to moderate-resolution surveys. We investigate this problem using pre-trained models, focusing on simple neural networks such as multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), with a case study transferring from LAMOST low-resolution spectra (LRS) to DESI medium-resolution spectra (MRS). Specifically, we pre-train MLPs on either LRS or their embeddings and fine-tune them for application to DESI stellar spectra. We compare MLPs trained directly on spectra with those trained on embeddings derived from transformer-based models (self-supervised foundation models pre-trained for multiple downstream tasks). We also evaluate different fine-tuning strategies, including residual-head adapters, LoRA, and full fine-tuning. We find that MLPs pre-trained on LAMOST LRS achieve strong performance, even without fine-tuning, and that modest fine-tuning with DESI spectra further improves the results. For iron abundance, embeddings from a transformer-based model yield advantages in the metal-rich ([Fe/H] > -1.0) regime, but underperform in the metal-poor regime compared to MLPs trained directly on LRS. We also show that the optimal fine-tuning strategy depends on the specific stellar parameter under consideration. These results highlight that simple pre-trained MLPs can provide competitive cross-survey generalization, while the role of spectral foundation models for cross-survey stellar parameter estimation requires further exploration.
