 - **Abstract**
 The dark matter flux in a direct detection experiment depends on its local speed distribution. This distribution has been inferred from simulations of Milky Way-like galaxies, but such models serve only as proxies given that no simulation directly captures the detailed evolution of our own Galaxy. This motivates alternative approaches which obtain this distribution directly from observations. In this work, we utilize 98 Milky Way analogues from the IllustrisTNG50 simulation to develop and validate a procedure for inferring the dark matter speed distribution using the kinematics of nearby stars. We find that the dark matter that originated from old mergers, plus that from recent non-luminous accretions, is well described by a Maxwell-Boltzmann speed distribution centered at the local standard-of-rest velocity. Meanwhile, recently accreted dark matter from massive mergers has speeds that can be traced from the associated stellar debris of these events. The stellar populations systematically underestimate the velocity dispersion of their dark matter counterparts, but a simple kinematic boost brings the two into good alignment. Using the TNG50 host galaxies, we demonstrate that combining these two contributions provides an accurate reconstruction of the local dark matter speeds. As an application of the procedure to our own Galaxy, we utilize stellar kinematic data from Gaia to quantify how the dark matter remnants from the Milky Way's last major merger impact its speed distribution in the Solar neighborhood.

 - **Abstract**
 Wide-angle tail (WAT) and narrow-angle tail (NAT) radio active galactic nuclei (RAGNs) are key tracers of dense environments in galaxy groups and clusters, yet no machine-learning classifier of bent RAGNs has been trained using both unlabeled data and purely visually inspected labels. We release the RGC Python package, which includes two newly preprocessed labeled datasets of 639 WATs and NATs derived from a publicly available catalog of visually inspected sources, along with a semi-supervised RGC model that leverages 20,000 unlabeled RAGNs. The two labeled datasets in RGC were preprocessed using PyBDSF which retains spurious sources, and Photutils which removes them. The RGC model integrates the self-supervised framework BYOL (Bootstrap YOur Latent) with the supervised E2CNN (E2-equivariant Convolutional Neural Network) to form a semi-supervised binary classifier. The RGC model, when trained and evaluated on a dataset devoid of spurious sources, reaches peak performance, attaining an accuracy of 88.88% along with F1-scores of 0.90 for WATs and 0.85 for NATs. The model's attention patterns amid class imbalance suggest that this work can serve as a stepping stone toward developing physics-informed foundation models capable of identifying a broad range of AGN physical properties.

 - **Abstract**
 Low-surface-brightness (LSB) structures play a crucial role in understanding galaxy evolution by providing significant insights into galaxy interactions, the histories of mass assembly, and the distribution of dark matter. Nevertheless, their inherently faint nature, coupled with observational difficulties such as stray light interference and variations in the sky background, has significantly impeded comprehensive studies of LSB features. The KASI Deep Rolling Imaging Fast Telescope (K-DRIFT) project aims to address these observational challenges by developing off-axis freeform three-mirror telescopes and observational strategies specifically designed for LSB imaging surveys. The first generation of the K-DRIFT (K-DRIFT G1) has been successfully completed, and the forthcoming survey, scheduled to commence shortly, is expected to yield novel insights into the LSB universe. This paper outlines the scientific motivations of the project, discusses the technical challenges encountered, highlights the innovative solutions devised, and describes the future trajectory of the K-DRIFT.
#### Multivariate Time Series Classification of Fermi - Detected Gamma-Ray Transients Using Convolutional-Recurrent Neural Networks

 - **Abstract**
 Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope has detected a diverse range of gamma-ray transients since its launch in 2008. Over the years, Fermi has accumulated an extensive public archive of transient events. Traditional classification methods for these events typically rely on fixed thresholds, localisation accuracy, and characteristic light curve features. However, in the current era of time-critical, multi-wavelength, and multi-messenger astronomy, rapid and reliable classification is essential to enable timely follow-up and coordinated observations. In this work, we develop and present two deep learning-based classifiers that integrate convolutional and recurrent neural network architectures. Using multivariate time-series inputs derived from Fermi-GBM data, our models are trained to distinguish among four classes of gamma-ray transients: Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), Terrestrial Gamma-ray Flashes (TGFs), Solar Flares (SFLAREs), and Soft Gamma Repeaters (SGRs). Furthermore, the models are designed to flag events that do not conform to any of these categories, providing a pathway for identifying potentially new or rare transient types. Training was conducted using a carefully curated subset of high-confidence Fermi events. The resulting models achieve an overall classification accuracy of 93%, and identify approximately 2.5% of the triggers as outliers of unknown origin. When applied to Fermi events with uncertain classifications, our models assign 60% of them to the TGF category with over 60% confidence. These results demonstrate that incorporating deep learning-based classification into onboard or automated data pipelines can significantly enhance transient identification, minimize misclassification, and improve the discovery potential of new phenomena in future high-energy astrophysics missions.

 - **Abstract**
 Upcoming surveys will produce billions of galaxy images but comparatively few spectra, motivating models that learn cross-modal representations. We build a dataset of 134,533 galaxy images (HSC-PDR2) and spectra (DESI-DR1) and adapt a Multi-Modal Masked Autoencoder (MMAE) to embed both images and spectra in a shared representation. The MMAE is a transformer-based architecture, which we train by masking 75% of the data and reconstructing missing image and spectral tokens. We use this model to test three applications: spectral and image reconstruction from heavily masked data and redshift regression from images alone. It recovers key physical features, such as galaxy shapes, atomic emission line peaks, and broad continuum slopes, though it struggles with fine image details and line strengths. For redshift regression, the MMAE performs comparably or better than prior multi-modal models in terms of prediction scatter even when missing spectra in testing. These results highlight both the potential and limitations of masked autoencoders in astrophysics and motivate extensions to additional modalities, such as text, for foundation models.
#### A test of Amati relation using HII galaxy distances

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.22979

 - **Abstract**
 We use model-independent luminosity distances of 186 HII galaxy observations to address the circularity problem in the Amati relation for Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs). For this purpose, we used Artificial Neural Network based interpolation to reconstruct the luminosity distance corresponding to the GRB redshift. We then use two independent GRB datasets to test the robustness of the Amati relation at redshifts below $z=2.6$. Our best-fit Amati relation parameters are consistent for the same datasets to within $1\sigma$. The intrinsic scatters which we obtain for the two datasets of about 28\% and 35\%, are comparatively larger. This implies that the Amati relation using HII galaxies as distance anchors cannot be used as a probe of precision cosmology.

 - **Abstract**
 The morphology of ionized gas velocity maps provides a direct probe of the internal gas kinematics of galaxies. Using integral field spectroscopy from SDSS-IV MaNGA, we analyze a sample of 528 low-inclination, regular disk galaxies to investigate the correlations between velocity map morphology, star formation rate, and gas-phase metallicity. We quantify velocity map morphology using harmonic expansion and adopt two complementary diagnostics: the global kinematic asymmetry, which traces non-axisymmetric perturbations, and the first-order term ratio, which captures axisymmetric radial motions. We find that galaxies with higher kinematic asymmetry are more likely to deviate from the scaling relations, typically lying either above or below the star formation main sequence and systematically below the mass-metallicity relation. In contrast, the first-order term ratio shows only a correlation with gas-phase metallicity in the low-mass range and no significant dependence on star formation rate. Moreover, galaxies below the mass-metallicity relation generally exhibit higher HI gas fractions. These results suggest that external gas accretion is the primary driver of the observed phenomena: inflowing metal-poor gas increases velocity map asymmetry in disk galaxies, dilutes the metallicity, and triggers enhanced star formation. Feedback-driven outflows, bar- and spiral-driven inflows, and galaxy mergers may also contribute, but likely play a secondary role.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel method for both forecasting and recasting upper limits (ULs) on dark matter (DM) annihilation cross sections, $\left< \sigma v \right>^{UL}$, or decay lifetime $\tau^{LL}$ . The forecasting method relies solely on the instrument response functions (IRFs) to predict ULs for a given observational setup, without the need for full analysis pipelines. The recasting procedure uses published ULs to reinterpret constraints for alternative DM models or channels. We demonstrate its utility across a range of canonical annihilation channels, including $b\bar{b}$, $W^+W^-$, $\tau^+\tau^-$, and $\mu^+\mu^-$, and apply it to several major gamma-ray experiments, including MAGIC, \textit{Fermi}-LAT, and CTAO. Notably, we develop a recasting approach that remains effective even when the IRF is unavailable by extracting generalized IRF-dependent coefficients from benchmark channels. We apply this method to reinterpret ULs derived from standard spectra (e.g., PPPC4DMID) in terms of more recent DM scenarios, including a Higgsino-like model with mixed final states and spectra generated with the CosmiXs model. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations and direct comparison with published results confirm the robustness and accuracy of our method, with discrepancies remaining within statistical uncertainties. The algorithm is generally applicable to any scenario where the expected signal model is parametric, offering a powerful tool for reinterpreting existing gamma-ray limits and efficiently exploring the DM parameter space in current and future indirect detection experiments.

 - **Abstract**
 In a hierarchical $\Lambda$CDM Universe, cosmic filaments serve as the primary channels for matter accretion into galaxy clusters, influencing the shape of their dark matter halos. We investigate whether the elongation of galaxy clusters correlates with the orientation of surrounding filaments, providing the first observational test of this relationship in large supercluster regions. We identified and characterized cosmic filaments in two dimensions within the two superclusters that are part of the low-redshift sub-survey of the Chilean Cluster Galaxy Evolution Survey (CHANCES): the Shapley supercluster and the Horologium-Reticulum supercluster. We analyzed the alignment between filament directions --traced by galaxy distributions- and the triaxiality of cluster gravitational potentials --traced by X-ray emission- using publicly available optical and X-ray data. We have found that most (82%) of the X-ray clusters are associated with and interconnected by the optically detected filaments. The clusters-filaments alignment analysis shows that the elongation of most clusters is well aligned with nearby filaments, providing observational confirmation of theoretical predictions, with the alignment progressively reducing at larger cluster-centric distances ($> 1.6 r_{200}$). Overall, our results support the notion that filaments are the main source of galaxy accretion at redshift below 0.1 and additionally provide evidence that matter accretion through filaments shapes the gravitational potential of galaxy clusters. We propose this measurement as a simple observational proxy to determine the direction of accretion in clusters, which is key to understanding both galaxy evolution and the merger history of galaxy clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 A major goal of computational astrophysics is to simulate the Milky Way Galaxy with sufficient resolution down to individual stars. However, the scaling fails due to some small-scale, short-timescale phenomena, such as supernova explosions. We have developed a novel integration scheme of $N$-body/hydrodynamics simulations working with machine learning. This approach bypasses the short timesteps caused by supernova explosions using a surrogate model, thereby improving scalability. With this method, we reached 300 billion particles using 148,900 nodes, equivalent to 7,147,200 CPU cores, breaking through the billion-particle barrier currently faced by state-of-the-art simulations. This resolution allows us to perform the first star-by-star galaxy simulation, which resolves individual stars in the Milky Way Galaxy. The performance scales over $10^4$ CPU cores, an upper limit in the current state-of-the-art simulations using both A64FX and X86-64 processors and NVIDIA CUDA GPUs.

 - **Abstract**
 The Cosmic Vine is a massive protocluster at z=3.44 in the JWST CEERS field, offering an ideal laboratory for studying the early phases of cluster formation. Using the data from the DAWN JWST Archive, we conduct a comprehensive study on the large-scale structure, stellar mass function (SMF), quiescent members, and dark matter halos in the Cosmic Vine. First, we spectroscopically confirm 136 galaxies in the Vine at z=3.44, and an additional 47 galaxies belonging to a diffuse foreground structure at z=3.34 which we dub the Leaf. We identify four subgroups comprising the Cosmic Vine and two subgroups within the Leaf. Second, we identified 11 quiescent members with log(M*/Msun)=9.5-11.0, the largest sample of quiescent galaxies in overdense environments at z>3, which gives an enhanced quiescent galaxy number density 2x10^(-4)cMpc^(-3) that is three times above the field level at log(M*/Msun) > 10. Notably, these quiescent members form a tight red sequence on the color-magnitude diagram, making it one of the earliest red sequences known to date. Third, by constructing the SMFs for both star-forming and quiescent members, we find that both SMFs are top-heavy, with a significantly enhanced quiescent fraction at log(M*/Msun)>10.5 compared to field counterparts. The stellar mass-size analysis reveals that star-forming members are more compact at higher masses than their field counterparts. Finally, we estimate a halo mass of log(Mh/Msun)=13.2+-0.3 for the protocluster core, and log(Mh/Msun)=11.9-12.4 for satellite subgroups. The phase-space analysis indicates that three subgroups are likely infalling to the core. This work reveals a high abundance of massive galaxies and dark matter halos in a forming cluster, demonstrating the accelerated assembly of massive galaxies in massive halos when the Universe was less than 2 billion years old.

 - **Abstract**
 Determining the distribution of redshifts for galaxies in wide-field photometric surveys is essential for robust cosmological studies of weak gravitational lensing. We present the methodology, calibrated redshift distributions, and uncertainties of the final Dark Energy Survey Year 6 (Y6) weak lensing galaxy data, divided into four redshift bins centered at $\langle z \rangle = [0.414, 0.538, 0.846, 1.157]$. We combine independent information from two methods on the full shape of redshift distributions: optical and near-infrared photometry within an improved Self-Organizing Map $p(z)$ (SOMPZ) framework, and cross-correlations with spectroscopic galaxy clustering measurements (WZ), which we demonstrate to be consistent both in terms of the redshift calibration itself and in terms of resulting cosmological constraints within 0.1$\sigma$. We describe the process used to produce an ensemble of redshift distributions that account for several known sources of uncertainty. Among these, imperfection in the calibration sample due to the lack of faint, representative spectra is the dominant factor. The final uncertainty on mean redshift in each bin is $\sigma_{\langle z\rangle} = [0.012, 0.008,0.009, 0.024]$. We ensure the robustness of the redshift distributions by leveraging new image simulations and a cross-check with galaxy shape information via the shear ratio (SR) method.
