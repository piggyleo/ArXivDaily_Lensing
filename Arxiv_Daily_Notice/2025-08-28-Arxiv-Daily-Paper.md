 - **Abstract**
 As a benchmark for galaxy evolution and dark matter studies, the total mass of the Milky Way is a parameter of cosmological significance, and its value at large radii from the Galactic center remains highly uncertain. Following a hierarchical Bayesian inference approach, we measure the cumulative mass of the Milky Way using full 6D phase-space information of stars from the first data release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We employ 330 blue horizontal-branch stars (BHBs) and 110 RR Lyrae stars (RRLs) in DESI covering Galactocentric distances in the range $\sim$50--100 kpc. Within 100 kpc from the Galactic center, we report an enclosed mass of $M(<100\ {\rm kpc}) = 0.57^{+0.08}_{-0.07}\times10^{12}$ M$_\odot$ and $M(<100\ {\rm kpc}) = 0.55^{+0.12}_{-0.10}\times10^{12}$ M$_\odot$ when using BHBs and RRLs, respectively. Extrapolating our mass profiles beyond the extent of our data, we find the virial mass of the Galaxy to be $M_{200}=0.85^{+0.16}_{-0.14}\times10^{12}$ M$_\odot$ and $M_{200}=0.78^{+0.19}_{-0.15}\times10^{12}$ M$_\odot$, respectively. We validate the effectiveness and limitations of our method using mock BHBs and RRLs from two AuriDESI halos. These tests show that the code recovers the enclosed mass of the mock galaxy with high precision and accuracy between 50 and 200 kpc, independent of the stellar tracer used and their spatial distribution. The tests also suggest an underestimation of the galaxy's cumulative mass at a level of up to $\sim20$\% if stars close to the Galactic center are used in the models. Our mass estimates lay the groundwork for future inference of the Galactic mass with upcoming DESI data releases and spectroscopic surveys mapping the halo.
#### Constraints on dark matter annihilation and turbulent reacceleration set by high-frequency observations of the radio halo in the Coma cluster

 - **Abstract**
 We study the impact of the recent observation of the radio halo in the Coma galaxy cluster at 6.6 GHz with the Sardinia Radio Telescope on models based on turbulent reacceleration of electrons produced in dark matter annihilation processes. Observing at that frequency it is possible to obtain information on the electrons spectrum at energies where the effect of turbulent reacceleration becomes sub-dominant with respect to energy losses, and therefore to obtain information on the properties of seed electrons. Under the assumption that dark matter particles are neutralino-like particles annihilating at a rate close to the maximum allowed by Fermi-LAT upper limits in dwarf galaxies, we obtain some constraints on the intensity of the reacceleration and on the value of the neutralino mass. In particular, models with mass of the order of 10 GeV are generally disfavored, because they produce a high-frequency radio spectrum that can not reproduce the possible flattening observed between 5 and 6.6 GHz; on the other hand, models with mass of the order of 500 GeV, in order to reproduce the observed spectrum at frequencies below 100 MHz, require a reacceleration phase longer than $10^9$ yr, which would require more than one event responsible of the generation of turbulence in the cluster. The resulting optimal mass values are in the range 100--200 GeV, with a preference for the quark annihilation channel.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulation of a group of field dwarf galaxies which includes on-the-fly radiative transfer (RT) and is evolved to $z=0$. Emission from stars is included according to age-dependent spectra, and a redshift-dependent UV background. The inclusion of RT results in the formation of eight additional faint dwarf galaxies with stellar masses of $10^{4}$ M$_{\odot}$ to several $10^{5}$ M$_{\odot}$ and only old stellar populations, similar to the observed Ultra-Faint Dwarf galaxies. They formed before and during cosmic reionisation and were mostly quenched by $z \sim 3-4$. The simulated galaxies follow many observed scaling relations such as the stellar mass-halo mass relation, the mass-size relation, and the luminosity-velocity dispersion relation. For the more massive dwarf galaxies, radiative feedback suppresses star formation, making it less bursty and reducing explosive outflows. This consequently reduces the dark matter core sizes by a factor of 2-3, rendering the core sizes ($\sim$ 1 kpc) more consistent with observations. The distribution of HI in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) is ubiquitous with a covering fraction of unity within $R_{vir}$, in good agreement with observations. It is rather insensitive to radiative or SN feedback at $z=0$, but at $z>5$ it is much higher in the RT simulation. In contrast, the distribution of low ions like SiII is very compact and declines sharply beyond the ISM scale. CIV and OVI have a more extended distribution, but their column densities are generally below the detection limit. Radiative feedback leads to smaller column densities of the metal ions, partly due to the reduction of total metal production, and partly because hard photons from the stellar radiation escape the ISM and further ionise the CGM. The abundance of CIV is particularly sensitive to the latter effect.

 - **Abstract**
 The galaxy LEDA 1313424 has recently been discovered to have nine rings [1]. The authors of the discovery paper interpret the rings to be the result of the passing of a smaller galaxy through the center of the LEDA galaxy 56 Myr ago. We point out several difficulties with this interpretation and propose instead that the rings of LEDA are the imprint upon baryonic matter of caustic rings of dark matter. Caustic rings of dark matter, with the pattern of radii observed in the LEDA galaxy, form if the dark matter is axions. Because they move slowly (LEDA's 70 kpc ring, for example, has speed 6.6 km/s) caustic rings of dark matter are plausible sites for the star formation observed in LEDA.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: This research presents unsupervised machine learning and statistical methods to identify and analyze tidal tails in open star clusters using data from the Gaia-DR3 catalog. Aims: We aim to identify member stars, detect and analyze tidal tails in five open clusters, BH 164, Alessi 2, NGC 2281, NGC 2354, and M67, of ages between 60 Myr and 4 Gyr. These clusters were selected based on the previous evidence of extended tidal structures. Methods: We utilized machine learning algorithms such as Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), along with statistical methods to analyze the kinematic, photometric, and astrometric properties of stars. Key characteristics of tidal tails, including radial velocity, color-magnitude diagram, and spatial projections in the tangent plane beyond the cluster's Jacobi radius ($r_J$), were used to detect them. We used N-body simulations to visualize and compare the observables with real data. Further analysis was done on the detected cluster and tail stars to study their internal dynamics and populations, including binary fraction. We also applied the residual velocity method to detect rotational patterns in the clusters and their tails. Results: We identified tidal tails in all five clusters, with detected tails extending farther in some clusters and containing significantly more stars than previously reported (tails ranging from 40 to 100 pc, one to four times the Jacobi radius, with 100 - 200 tail stars). The luminosity functions of the tails and their parent clusters were generally consistent, and tails lacked massive stars. In general, the binary fraction was found to be higher in the tidal tails. Significant rotation was detected in M67 and NGC 2281 for the first time.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmological models of hierarchical structure formation predict the existence of a widespread population of dual accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) on kpc-scale separations, corresponding to projected distances < 0".8 at redshifts higher than 0.5. However, close companions to known active galactic nuclei (AGN) or quasars (QSOs) can also be multiple images of the object itself, strongly lensed by a foreground galaxy, as well as foreground stars in a chance superposition. Thanks to its large sky coverage, sensitivity, and high spatial resolution, Euclid offers a unique opportunity to obtain a large, homogeneous sample of dual/lensed AGN candidates with sub-arcsec projected separations. Here we present a machine learning approach, in particular a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to identify close companions to known QSOs down to separations of $\sim\,$0".15 comparable to the Euclid VIS point spread function (PSF). We studied the effectiveness of the CNN in identifying dual AGN and demonstrated that it outperforms traditional techniques. Applying our CNN to a sample of $\sim\,$6000 QSOs from the Q1 Euclid data release, we find a fraction of about 0.25% dual AGN candidates with separation $\sim\,$0".4 (corresponding to $\sim$3 kpc at z=1). Estimating the foreground contamination from stellar objects, we find that most of the pair candidates with separation higher than 0".5 are likely contaminants, while below this limit, contamination is expected to be less than 20%. For objects at higher separation (>0".5, i.e. 4 kpc at z=1), we performed PSF subtraction and used colour-colour diagrams to constrain their nature. We present a first set of dual/lensed AGN candidates detected in the Q1 Euclid data, providing a starting point for the analysis of future data releases.
#### Gravitational Microlensing of the Galactic Centre $γ$-Ray Excess: A New Test for Point-Like or Extended Emission?

 - **Abstract**
 We present a potential test of the origin of the $\gamma$-ray Galactic Centre Excess (GCE). We demonstrate how gravitational microlensing by stellar mass objects along the line of sight to the Galactic Bulge can distinguish between the possibility of extensive emission due to dark matter self-annihilation from more prosaic astrophysical sources, namely millisecond pulsars. Such an astrophysical origin would result in emission from a population of small, currently unresolved point-like sources - in contrast to the expected smoother emission resulting from dark matter annihilation. Given that the scale of gravitational microlensing, that is, the Einstein radius for stellar mass lenses, and hence, the degree of induced magnification, is sensitive to the size of the emitting region, such microlensing will induce time variability in the emission of astrophysical sources, whereas $\gamma$-ray emission from dark matter annihilation will effectively be immune to such influences. However, we find that detecting microlensing-induced variability requires significantly greater sensitivity than that of current or planned $\gamma$-ray detectors. For a small population of bright GCE sources, more than an order-of-magnitude increase in effective area over Fermi-LAT would be required, with events remaining extremely rare. For a large population of faint sources, events would occur multiple times a year, but would only be detectable with a four-order-of-magnitude improvement. Whilst microlensing might not be a definitive test of the origin of the GCE, in future observations, it may prove useful in determining the properties of any point-like source population.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of a vertical velocity anomaly (VVA) in the stellar component of the Galactic disk, consistent with the impact of a dark, ultra-compact dwarf galaxy (UCD)-sized object plunging into the Milky Way. The anomaly spatially coincides with a suite of gaseous disturbances -- including an \Hone\ void, a molecular shell (CO 16.134--0.553), and a vertical \Hone\ filament -- previously interpreted as signatures of a dark matter subhalo (DMSH) collision. Analysis of Gaia DR2 astrometry reveals a statistically significant vertical velocity dip co-located with these features, supporting a dynamical origin. The absence of a luminous source at the filament's terminus suggests a dark or failed UCD. These results provide rare observational evidence for a low-mass DMSH, with implications for the substructure of dark matter halos and constraints on the $\Lambda$CDM model.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel analytical framework employing Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to constrain the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ through the analysis of stellar orbits around the supermassive black hole (SMBH) Sgr A* at the Galactic center. Focusing on the well-observed S2 star, we use an inverse PINN (iPINN) architecture to infer orbital elements and estimate the total precession angle from astrometric data. By isolating the contribution from $\Lambda$, which is defined as the difference between the total precession and the Schwarzschild precession, we derive a stringent upper bound of $\Lambda \leq 5.67 \times 10^{-40}, \mathrm{m}^{-2}$, which is approximately two orders of magnitude tighter than previous estimates obtained using similar data-driven methods. Extension of our analysis to two additional long-period S-stars, S1 and S9, reveals that while the cosmological precession becomes relatively more prominent in such systems, limited orbital coverage introduces significant uncertainties in parameter estimation. Among the cases examined, the constraint derived from S2 remains the most robust. Our results highlight the potential of PINN-based approaches for extracting physical insights from sparse or noisy astronomical data. Future applications to next-generation observational data and further methodological improvements in machine learning are expected to refine the cosmological constraints and enable broader tests of gravitational theories.
#### Constraining Ricci-Cubic Holographic Dark Energy from observational data using the MCMC sampling and enhanced Machine learning analysis

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.19961

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we find constraints on the parameter space of the Ricci-Cubic Holographic dark energy (RCHDE) from various observational data sets like Hubble data, cosmic-chronometer data, Baryon-acoustic oscillation data, and also data from gamma-ray bursts. RCHDE is formed from the cubic invariant, which in turn is built from the cubic contractions of the Riemann and Ricci tensors. We have used the Markov chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) sampling technique to find constraints on the model parameters via Bayesian inference. Contour plots have been obtained for the model parameters, showing their marginalized and joint probability distributions. The best-fit regression lines are found for the constrained model and compared with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model to verify and validate the model. To complement this data analysis mechanism, we have also performed an enhanced machine learning analysis using observational Hubble parameter data. This approach serves to validate the model's predictive power through independent, data-driven regression techniques. Different graphical illustrations of the machine learning techniques have been presented to understand the results. These illustrations reveal a strong agreement between the Hubble parameter predictions from the machine learning models, the theoretical RCHDE model, and observational data.

 - **Abstract**
 We have conducted a search for strong gravitational lensing systems in the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Legacy Imaging Surveys Data Release 10 (DR10). This paper is the fourth in a series of searches (following Huang et al. 2020; Huang et al. 2021; Storfer et al. 2024, Paper I, II, & III respectively). This is the first catalog of lens candidates covering nearly the entirety of the extragalactic sky south of declination $\delta\approx +32$ deg, all of it observed by the DECam, covering $\sim$14,000 $deg^2$. We impose a $z$-band magnitude cut of < 20 in AB magnitude. We deploy a Residual Neural Network and EfficientNet as an ensemble trained on a compilation of known lensing systems and high-grade candidates as well as nonlenses in the same footprint. The predictions from these two base models are aggregated using a meta-learner. After applying our ensemble to the survey data, we exclude known candidates and systems, and use our own visual inspection portal to rank images in the top 0.01 percentile of all neural network recommendations. We have found 811 new lens candidates. These include 484 new candidates in the Legacy Surveys DR9 footprint, all parts of which have been searched for strong lenses at least once before, either by our group or others. Combining the discoveries from this work with those from Paper I (335), II (1210), and III (1512), we have discovered a total of 3868 new candidates in the DESI Legacy Surveys.
