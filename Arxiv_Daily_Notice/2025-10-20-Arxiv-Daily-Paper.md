 - **Abstract**
 The intracluster medium (ICM) records the history of galaxy clusters through its complex dynamical properties. To effectively interpret these properties, robust methods are needed to compare observational data with theoretical models. We present a novel machine learning framework for comparing ICM line-of-sight velocity maps derived from X-ray observations. Our approach uses convolutional and Siamese neural networks to identify similarities between different kinematic fields. We outline the architecture of this framework and perform a series of sanity checks to validate its performance. These checks demonstrate the model's ability to correctly identify and quantify kinematic features, establishing a powerful new tool for future comparative studies of the ICM.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission from cosmic ray (CR) protons scattering off the gas in the intracluster and intergalactic medium (ICM and IGM) remains out of reach for current observations. Detecting this emission would provide constraints on intergalactic magnetic fields as well as dark matter interaction models. Aims: We aim to provide estimates for diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission in the Fermi-LAT band from galaxy clusters and the cosmic web in the local Universe. Methods: In this work we show results from the first cosmological MHD simulation with an on-the-fly spectral CR model. We model CR injection at shocks, account for adiabatic energy changes and advection of CR protons, and obtain their $\gamma$-ray emissivity directly from the simulated CR energy density and spectra. For this we use constrained initial conditions, which evolve in a field closely resembling that of the local Universe, allowing direct comparison to Fermi-LAT data on massive clusters. Results: We find CR proton acceleration at all structure formation and accretion shocks in galaxy clusters and cosmic web filaments. These protons provide the basis for diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission in these regimes. The absolute value of the diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission in our simulation lies a few orders of magnitude below the current upper limits found by Fermi-LAT. Under the assumption of our model, a sensitivity of $F_\gamma < 10^{-11} \: \gamma~ \text{s}^{-1}~\text{cm}^{-2}$ is required for a detection of diffuse emission in Coma.
#### A rising tide: Intrinsic alignments since the turn of the millennium

 - **Abstract**
 The alignments of galaxies across the large-scale structure of the Universe are known to be a source of contamination for gravitational lensing, but they can also probe cosmology and the physics of galaxy evolution in many ways. In this review, I cover developments in our understanding of intrinsic alignments over the past 25 years on: (1) different approaches to model intrinsic alignments across a range of scales, (2) existing observational constraints, (3) predictions from cosmological numerical $N$-body and hydrodynamical simulations, (4) mitigation strategies to account for their contamination to lensing observables and (5) cosmological and astrophysical applications. While the review focuses mostly on two-point statistics of intrinsic alignments, I also give a summary of other statistics beyond two-point. Finally, I point out some of the open problems hindering the understanding or application of intrinsic alignments and how they might be overcome in the future.
#### Velocity dispersion profiles of dwarf spheroidal galaxies with self-interacting ultralight dark matter

 - **Abstract**
 Dark-matter-dominated dwarf galaxies provide an excellent laboratory for testing dark matter models at small scale and, in particular, the ultralight dark matter (ULDM) class of models. Within the framework of self-interacting bosonic dark matter, we use the observed velocity-dispersion pro- files of seven dwarf spheroidal galaxies to constrain the parameters of ULDM. In our modeling, we account for the impact of the baryonic component on the velocity dispersion and ULDM halo structure. We find that in the regime of repulsively interacting ULDM, the self-interaction, which fits the observations, is almost negligible, consistent with non-interacting ULDM with a boson mass of approximately 1.6*10^(-22) eV. In contrast, for attractively interacting ULDM, the best fit corre- sponds to a smaller boson mass of about 1.3*10^(-22) eV, with self-interaction playing a significant role in shaping the dark-matter halo and thereby influencing the interpretation of observations.
#### A merger within a merger: Chandra pinpoints the short GRB 230906A in a peculiar environment

 - **Abstract**
 We report the precise X-ray localization of GRB~230906A, a short duration ($T_{90}\sim$0.9 s) burst with no optical or radio counterpart. Deep imaging with the Hubble Space Telescope detects a faint galaxy (G$^\ast$; $F160W\simeq26$ AB mag) coincident with the sub-arcsecond X-ray position. Compared with standard GRB galaxies, its faintness, compact size and color would suggest a high redshift ($z\gtrsim$3) host. However, our observations also reveal the presence of a galaxy group at $z\!\sim$0.453, confirmed spectroscopically with VLT/MUSE, with clear signs of interactions and mergers among group members. The GRB and its putative host project onto an extended ($\approx$180 kpc) tidal tail emerging from the group's central galaxy. The probability of a chance alignment is small ($P_{cc}\!\lesssim\!4$\%), we thus argue that the GRB and its galaxy G$^*$ reside within the group. Their peculiar location along the tidal debris suggests that an enhanced burst of star formation, induced by the galaxy merger, might have formed the progenitor compact binary $\lesssim$700 Myr ago. The compact binary later evolved in a neutron star merger which produced GRB 230906A and injected $r$-process material into the surrounding circumgalactic medium.
